    <p>Transcriber’s Note:</p>
    <p>On page <a href='#Page_66'>66</a> (beginning "seas, and streams, on the same
      principle" and ending "They also, to a certain extent,
      retain their distinction into white and") there are several
      words and phrases in Anglo-Saxon that were impossible to
      transcribe exactly as in the original. The characters are
      not available in the Unicode standard. However, those words
      were found in “The Student’s Dictionary of Anglo-Saxon” by
      Henry Sweet available on-line here:
      <a href="https://archive.org/details/studentsdictiona00swee">
      https://archive.org/details/studentsdictiona00swee</a>

<p class='c021'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>888.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>The</span> <i>Orkney Islands</i> were probably visited by the
northern pirates at a period much earlier than is generally
supposed. If, from their barrenness and from their
limited surface, they offered no inducement to permanent
occupancy, they were useful as strongholds,—as
ports where the northern ships might anchor in safety.
From their position between Scandinavia and Ireland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>which we know was hostilely visited in the year 795,
they must have been frequently subject to the ravages
of the strangers. The Pictish inhabitants, who were
not warlike or numerous, had the mortification to witness
the frequent seizure of their cattle, their fish, their
corn, and such other stores as they had been able to
collect or to produce. Their only advantage was in
their poverty, which shortened the stay of these avaricious
men. But after the battle of Hafursfiord (885), these
islands became the perpetual abode of the sea-rovers,
who were no longer tolerated in Norway<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c023'><sup>[1]</sup></a>; here they
fitted out expeditions to ravage every coast from the
south of Ireland to the extremity of the Gulf of Finland.
So frequent and so formidable were those ravages
that in 888—three years after his glorious victory—Harald
Harfagre, with a view of suppressing them,
sailed with a powerful armament into these seas. The
isles of Shetland, of Orkney, of the Hebrides, and
Man, were subdued by him. But to conquer was little,
unless some measure were adopted to secure the conquest.
The monarch determined to place one of his most valiant
and most respectable chiefs over the islands, and
cast his eyes on Rognevald, jarl of Moria, who, in the
present expedition, had lost one of his sons. But
Rognevald, attached to his hereditary domains in
Norway, induced his royal master to invest his brother
Sigurd with the dignity. Sigurd, therefore, was the
first jarl, or earl, of the Orkneys.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>889 to 892.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>This chief had qualities worthy of the post: he was
valiant, liberal, politic. But he was also ambitious:
he longed to reduce a portion of the neighbouring continent;
and, as his own forces were unequal to an attempt
of such magnitude, he formed an alliance with Thorstein
the Red, son of Olaf the White, a chief famous in the
annals of Norway. Having effected a junction, the two
jarls subdued Caithness and Sutherland, and then extended
their ravages into the counties of Ross and Moray.
In the latter, Sigurd, who was intent on durable conquest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>is said to have built a fortress. But he soon
afterwards died,—whether in battle, or in consequence
of a wound, is not very clear; and all the advantages
which he had gained were lost. He was succeeded,
indeed, by his son, Guthrum; but the latter, alike feeble
in mind and body, soon paid the debt of nature. The
depredations of the pirates were resumed; and Rognevald,
who had been the feudal superior of Sigurd, was required
to nominate another governor. His choice fell
on Hallad, one of his sons. But it was less fortunate
than the preceding one. If Hallad had the wish, he
certainly had not the power, to contend with the frequent
piratical bands who infested the islands: he soon
deserted his post, and returned to Norway. The father
lamented his unfortunate choice; still more did he lament
the stain which want of success had brought upon his
name. His children, he bitterly observed, were sadly
degenerated from the ancient valour of their line.
He could not foresee that Einar, one of them, was
about to confer splendour on the family; still less that
Rollo, another of them, would become the head of a
powerful race of sovereigns. Rollo proposed to clear
the islands from the piratical bands; but his proposal
was declined, probably from want of confidence in his
powers. And when Einar prayed the old jarl to send
<i>him</i> to the government, the chief reason of his success was
the little favour which he possessed in the eyes of his
father. He was an illegitimate son; his mother was
of servile condition; he had lost an eye; his countenance
was in other respects repulsive; and all these circumstances
combined to render the paternal roof disagreeable
to him. The saga has preserved the words
in which he made the application to his father:—“Thou
hast never shown <i>me</i> much honour, nor will my departure
afflict thee: wherefore I will proceed to the west,
if thou wilt afford me the means. Do this, and I
promise thee never to revisit Norway!” The old man
gave him a large vessel, manned with good mariners;
told him that he had no confidence in his valour or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>prudence, and expressed a hope that he should see him
no more. His prayer was granted.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>893 to 936.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>On the arrival of Einar, his conduct proved that he
to had not overrated his own powers. Over two pirate
chiefs, who had, since the death of Sigurd, held the
dominion of the islands, he triumphed; he governed
the inhabitants by his wisdom, no less than protected
them by his valour; and joined with his firmness such
moderation that he became exceedingly popular with
his people. His celebrity inspired with envy the sons
of king Harald, who equally hated his father: that
father was burnt to death, with many of his companions<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c023'><sup>[2]</sup></a>;
and a fate no less tragical was reserved for Einar. In
894, Halfdan, one of his sons by the Finnish lady (he
had three of the name<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c023'><sup>[3]</sup></a>), reached the Orkneys unexpected
by Einar, who, being wholly unprepared for
defence, fled into Caithness. In his turn, Halfdan was
surprised by the jarl, and compelled to hide himself;
but he was discovered and put to death, in revenge
alike for the unprovoked aggression and for the murder
of Rognevald. In this act of retribution, as it might be
considered by a pagan, there was much temerity. The
monarch armed to punish it, and, in 895, again appeared
off the coast with a powerful armament. Unable to
resist, Einar again fled into Caithness, a portion, if not
the whole of which, was entirely subject to the jarls of
the Orkneys. He had certainly formidable means
of defence; so formidable, indeed, as to make Harald
listen to overtures of accommodation. Probably, too, as
a pagan, he made considerable allowance for the act of
Einar, who, in avenging the death of a father, had done
what religion dictated. At length he professed his
readiness both to pardon the islanders, and to leave the
jarl in the government, if sixty golden merks were paid
him. This sum, moderate as it may seem, they were
unable to raise; but Einar agreed to pay it for them,
on the condition that their lands should be considered
his until they found the means of redemption. Relieved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>from this formidable enemy, Einar resumed with his
usual success the duties of government. By posterity
he was called <i>Turf</i>-Einar, from his introducing, we are
told, the use of that article. It is, however, scarcely to
be credited that the islanders should, in his time, be
ignorant of it. They had no wood; and sea-weed alone
could not have sufficed them through the long and dreary
winter. Probably he introduced some improvement into
the manner of preparing it; and thus earned a title to
their gratitude.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>936 to 946.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>On the death of Einar, the government of the
Orkneys, and of the most northern counties of Scotland,
devolved on two of his sons, Arnkel and Erlend.
If they had the ambition they had not the wisdom
of the father. When Eric of the Bloody Axe was expelled
from Norway by Hako the Good<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c023'><sup>[4]</sup></a>, they received
him with readiness, became his allies, and accompanied
him in his predatory expedition against the
Scottish and English coasts. For a time, indeed, fortune
seemed to smile upon them. Eric became the governor
of Northumbria, as the vassal of king Athelstane:
they shared in his prosperity, and in the wealth which
he acquired in his piratical expeditions to the coasts of
Scotland and Ireland; but they also shared his tragical
fate in the battle which the royal Edred waged against
the northmen, and which for ever united Northumbria
with the Anglo-Saxon crown.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c023'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>946 to 980.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>These princes were succeeded by another brother,
Thorfin Hausak-liufurs, whose administration, the result
of his wisdom, was one of great prosperity. Not
so that of his sons.  Of these he left five. The
eldest, Arnfin, married Ragnilda, the daughter of
Eric Blodoxe and the infamous Gunhilda, and quite
worthy of her parentage. Through her Arnfin, the
victim of treachery, descended to an untimely grave.
Havard, the next brother, succeeded to the government;
and his conduct was so wise and prosperous, that he
obtained the name of the Happy. But he had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>folly to marry the widowed Ragnilda; and he suffered
the deserved penalty of his weakness. She had
transferred, we are told, her affection to Liot, the next
brother; and with the view of obtaining the gratification
of her wishes, had provoked a quarrel between Havard
and a kinsman that proved fatal to the former. But
such a woman could have no affection; and her motive
to the deed was probably dislike of her husband’s
ascendency. However this be, she became the wife of
the third brother, who succeeded to the government.
But Liot had little reason to congratulate himself on his
elevation. The readiness with which he had become the
instrument of a base and bloody woman roused the
anger of Skuli, the next brother, who, being no less
ambitious, resolved to dethrone him. Repairing to the
court of the Scottish king, he offered to hold the islands
as a fief of the crown, if, through the royal aid, he
were raised to the dignity now held by Liot. The
offer was accepted; and, at the head of a considerable
force, he returned into Caithness, which declared for
him. In the centre of that province the kinsmen
met, and victory declared for Liot,—Skuli being left
dead on the field. But the Scots now appeared in
greater numbers; and though the jarl triumphed in a
second engagement, he received a wound which brought
him to his end in the year 980. The authority now
passed into the hands of Laudver, the fifth brother. Of
him we know only that he was addicted to piratical expeditions,
that he married an Irish princess, and that
he reigned sixteen years.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>980 to 1014.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Sigurd, the son and successor of the last jarl, occupies
more room in fable than in history. Rejecting the
former, we may observe, that he had many great qualities;
that he was valiant, generous, persevering; that
he freed his people from the obligation which they had
contracted to the jarls in the days of Turf-Einar, thus
restoring the lands, which had lately been feudal, to their
original allodial state; and that in addition to the Shetland
Isles and the two Scottish counties, which had for nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>a century been under the jurisdiction of his predecessors,
he held some fortresses, and, we are told, some extensive
demesnes, in the heart of Scotland. Yet these might be
held as a vassal of the Sottish monarch. But the most
memorable event in his administration was the introduction
of Christianity into the Orkneys. To this
event we have before alluded<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c023'><sup>[6]</sup></a>, but it requires a more
ample detail. Sigurd being summoned on board the
vessel which carried Olaf Trygveson from Ireland to
Norway, was told that if he did not immediately receive
Christianity, cause his people to receive it, and do
homage to Olaf as the heir of Harald Harfagre, he, and
all who refused, should be put to death. At this moment
Olaf had not ascended the throne of Norway, which
was occupied by jarl Hako; and Sigurd might well hesitate
to acknowledge him. Again, though he must have
frequently heard of the religion which he was now required
to embrace, he had been accustomed to despise
it, because it was professed by the peaceable—that is,
the cowardly—portion of mankind. He, therefore,
began to make some excuse for his inability to comply
with the demand; but none would be admitted; and as
he had to choose between obedience and instant death,
he naturally selected the former. He and his people,
with one accord, submitted to the rite; and to secure
his fidelity, he gave his son as hostage. On the death
of that son, however, he renounced his allegiance to the
Norwegian crown, and entered into a close connection
with that of Scotland, by marrying a daughter of king
Malcolm. Probably this new alliance prevented him
from renouncing Christianity with as much facility as
he had renounced his dependence on Norway. It certainly
increased his power, and the consideration in which
he was held by the chiefs of the age. He was one of
the leaders in the war against the Irish king Brian;
and, with many others, he was killed at the battle of
Clontarf.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c023'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Such a man, in such an age, could not, of
course, be permitted to fall in the ordinary way. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>scalds are to be credited, he had some presentiment of
his fate before he left the islands; and he confided the
administration to his three sons by the first wife, Einar,
Sumerled, and Brusi. Connected with his death are
two legends, which deserve a momentary notice. One
of his friends, who wished to accompany him, he insisted
on remaining, with the assurance that he should
be the first man to whom intelligence of the battle should
be communicated. One day the chief saw, as he thought,
jarl Sigurd approaching at the head of a troop of horse.
He instantly mounted, rode forward, met the jarl, embraced,
and, in the view of several followers, afterwards
disappeared with the jarl behind an eminence:
neither, adds the legend, was again seen in this world.
The other story has called forth the splendid effusion
of Grey:—Darrod, a native of Caithness, saw
twelve horsemen ride towards a hill, and immediately
enter it. Hastening to the place, and looking through
a small aperture, he perceived twelve gigantic women
weaving and singing; the woof and the song no less
supernatural than the singers.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c023'><sup>[8]</sup></a> This event, which is
placed in the year 1014, illustrates the mental condition
of the people, who, if they had outwardly embraced
Christianity, were still pagans in superstition.</p>

<p class='c024'>Of the Shetland Isles, during this period, we know
nothing. They formed, as we have observed, a portion
of the government of the Orkney jarls; and so did the
Hebrides. But the connection between the governors
and the governed must have been lax, and subject to
frequent interruption. The Hebrides were frequently
ravaged,—now by Norwegians, now by Danes, now by
fierce adventurers from all parts of the north. The
condition of Iona, the hallowed abode of St. Columba’s
disciples, was mournful. In 793 the monastery was laid
in ashes, and most of the inmates massacred; again in
797 and 801. In 805 sixty-eight more of the monks
suffered the same fate. From that period to the year
875 the barbarian ravages were frequent. To escape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>destruction, the monks fled; and when the pirates were
defeated, returned to the same hallowed spot, to quench
the still smoking ruins, and to rebuild the house of their
saint. After 875 the depredations of the northern rovers
were much less frequent. We read, indeed, of no massacre
until 985, when the abbot and fifteen of his monks
obtained the martyr’s crown. This seems to have been
the last disaster of the kind. Christianity, in a degree
far greater than the governments of Norway and the
Orkneys, was destroying the spirit of piracy. In 1093,
as we shall hereafter have occasion to relate, the Western
Isles, like Man and the Orkneys, were subdued by
Magnus of Norway, and annexed to his crown.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c023'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>5. <i>Iceland</i> (861, &amp;c.) was probably known to the
Irish missionaries before it was discovered by the Norwegians.
At least some articles were found there which
missionaries only could have left; and these must have
come from Iona or Ireland. “Before Iceland was discovered
by the Norwegians,” says the Landnamabok,
“men were there whom we call Papas, who professed
the Christian religion, and who were believed to have
come from the west.” The same authority also speaks
of the books in the Irish and the Anglo-Saxon languages;
of the bells, staves, and other articles left by
preceding visitors. But if any colony had ever settled
upon it, it had long been uninhabited when it was accidentally
discovered by Naddod, in 861. That sea-rover
left the Faroe Islands with the intention of steering
directly for the west of Norway; but a storm arising,
drove him far to the north-west, until he reached that
largest of the European isles. But he knew not it was
an island: he saw that it was covered with snow, and
from that circumstance he denominated it <i>Snoeland</i>.
Though he ascended several high mountains, he could
discern no trace of human beings. On his return he
acquainted his countrymen with the discovery. The following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>year it was again accidentally visited by a Swede,
Gardar Swafarson, who sailed round it, and ascertaining
it to be an island, gave it the name of Gardarsholm.
The season was too advanced for him to return; and he
passed the whole winter on the coast, living chiefly on
the fish which he caught in abundance. The third
person that visited it was the Norwegian Floki, surnamed
<i>Rafna</i>, or the Raven, from the manner in which, according
to legend, he found the island. Sailing from the
Faroes, he proceeded towards the north-west; but as he
was uncertain of the exact direction in which Snoeland
lay, he let fly three ravens, which he had previously
dedicated to the gods. One of these flew back to the
islands which he had left; another returned to the ship;
the third proceeded in a right line, and was followed by
Floki, until he reached the country which Naddod had
discovered. Its name he changed from Snoeland to
Iceland. He admired its boiling fountains and its
burning lava; but the country was too barren for his
subsistence: he was troubled at the mysterious quaking
of the earth; and he soon bade adieu to a region which
he had evidently designed to colonize, but which the
gods had doomed to everlasting desolation. His companions,
however, did not give so disheartening an account
of the island. They praised its fish, its climate,
its soil; and above all, they praised it because “it was
a place where men might live in freedom, far away
from kings and jarls.”</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>874.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The first attempt made to colonize the island was in
the year 874. Ingulf, the son of a Norwegian jarl,
had slain his adversary; and to escape the consequences
of the act, he, with his brother-in-law Jorleif, prepared
to visit a region where neither the vengeance of the
kindred nor that of Harald Harfagre could pursue him.
Deeply imbued with the superstition of the ancient
Norwegian worship, he offered due sacrifices to the
gods—for in these patriarchal times the privilege of
sacrificing descended with that of primogeniture; and
when he sailed took with him the ornamented doorposts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>of the apartment in which his household deities
were enshrined. These, as he approached the island,
he cast into the sea, and vowed that on the part of the
coast to which the elements should drive them, he
would establish his colony. In the meantime a promontory
on the south-east, still called Ingulfshod, received
him; but the door-posts, watched by his slaves,
proceeded to the south-west, and entered a bay on which
the modern Reykiavik stands. The place in which he
had fixed his temporary abode was comparatively fertile;
the neighbourhood of the bay for many leagues was unusually
sterile; yet in spite of all remonstrances Ingulf
removed to the latter spot, which he believed to be
divinely ordained for him. His companion, Jorleif,
chose a more fertile locality to the south; but Jorleif
had no reverence for the gods, to whom he never deigned
to sacrifice. In the estimation of many, the latter was
the wiser man; but in a short time he was murdered
by his own slaves, who fled with his substance to some
distant islands. They did not escape with impunity:
pursued by Ingulf, they paid the penalty of their crime.
However much the regret of the chief for the fate of his
friend, he piously observed that it was the lot of all
who despised the national divinities.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>884.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Ingulf was followed by several Norwegian chiefs, and
by a multitude of simple freemen, who desired “to live
far away from tyrannical kings and jarls.” In general,
each new community chose for itself some habitable
valley, fixed its boundaries, erected a rude temple to the
gods, and provided for the civil no less than the religious
administration. Of the jarls contemporary with Ingulf,
Thorolf was the most celebrated. Descended, in popular
opinion, like many other chiefs, from the divine
race which had held the government of the country,
Thorolf was at once the head of his clan and the pontiff
of his religion. Attached to the great temple of Thor,
on one of the islands close to the Norwegian coast, furnished
with a venerable beard, endowed with many
vassals, many flocks and herds, and a wide domain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Thorolf was one of the most influential chiefs in the
north of that kingdom. But he had the misfortune to
incur the wrath of Harald Harfagre, by giving an asylum
to Biorn, one of his kinsmen, who was persecuted by
that monarch. From a <i>Thing</i>, or public assembly of the
province, Harald obtained a decree of outlawry against
Thorolf, if, within a given period, he failed to surrender
Biorn. To ascertain the will of the gods, whether he
should give himself up to the king or flee to Iceland, he
sacrificed to Thor, and the reply favoured the latter
project. No less devout than Ingulf, he took with
him the statue of Thor, the earth on which the throne
had stood, and a portion of the temple. Approaching
the island, he threw into the sea the wooden columns
which had supported the sanctuary; and, as his predecessor
had done ten years before him, settled on the
spot to which the elements carried them. Marking the
boundaries of his new domain by walking round it with
a flaming brand and setting fire to the grass, his next
object was to build a large house, and then a large
temple, in which he was to officiate as the high-priest of
Thor. There were the same columns, the same throne,
the same mystic ring, and the same great altar. The
other divinities were placed in the niches prepared for
them; and the worship was celebrated with less pomp
indeed than in the parent country, but with equal fervour.
Close to the temple was the spot where the <i>Thing</i>,
or judicial assembly of the people, was held, in the open
air, in presence of “Freya, and Niord, and the Almighty
As,” by whom the witnesses in a suit always sware. The
ground of both was held to be holy; for the laws which
the ancient divinities had ordained were necessarily a
part of religion. This was the ordinary mode of proceeding
when any new colony was formed. By degrees,
as the cabins of the slaves increased, and were spread
over the domain, the aspect of the country became more
cheerful. The settlement of Thorolf was soon a flourishing
one; it was increased by many new arrivals
from Norway; and was at length divided into three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>populous districts, each of which recognized him as
chief pontiff, until human passion begun to produce its
inevitable result,—disunion and bloody feuds.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>874 to 936.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>At this distance of time, we do not estimate as we
ought the number of emigrants from Norway to this
newly-discovered island. Before the death of Harald
Harfagre, most of its habitable portions had their occupants.
What with the expulsion of the pirates, what
with the voluntary exile of the chiefs who disdained to
acknowledge a superior, the mother country must have
lost no inconsiderable proportion of its inhabitants. It
promised indeed to be left half peopled, when that monarch,
in conjunction with the nobles who still remained,
severely prohibited these emigrations. But neither he
nor they could always watch the ports; still less could
they control the motions of those who, while occupied
in traffic from coast to coast, seized the opportunity of
sailing for a land where there were no kings, no lords.
Yet this was only true of the earliest state of Icelandic
civilization. Subsequently, as the chiefs with their
numerous slaves and their warlike dependants repaired
to that place, a system resembling the clanship of
Norway, though less despotic, was introduced. They,
indeed, seized the land as their own, and parcelled it out
to their followers on certain conditions. Among these
conditions was always the payment of an annual rent in
agricultural produce, and of something for the support
of religion; but frequently was superadded some hereditary
jurisdiction in the family of the chief. As he
was often a pontiff no less than a patriarch, and was a
reputed descendant from the divine family of the Ynglings,
this union of the sacerdotal, of the judicial, and
of almost royal functions, invested him with a consideration
which he had scarcely enjoyed even in Norway.
He who filled this two-fold office of pontiff and civil
magistrate, who formed a sort of patriarchal aristocracy
not uninteresting to contemplate, was called <i>Godar</i>, or
<i>Haf-godar</i>. But in half a century after the colonization
of the island, an evil arose for which the social constitutions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of the period afforded no remedy. The isolation
of the communities led to the formation of a
separate rival spirit, which was often destructive to the
district. When two neighbouring communities or their
magistrates disputed, who was to act as the umpire?
There was no monarch, no hereditary chief of the province,
no Al-Thing, to decide between them. It became
necessary, therefore, either to renounce the advantages
of a general confederation, and to live in scattered independent
tribes, whose hostilities must soon have led to
the depopulation of the island, or to establish a superior
authority. Hence the selection of a supreme
judge, who was also empowered to collect laws, which,
however, could not be obligatory until they had been
accepted by the chiefs and the people of each community.
The first Icelander raised to this high dignity
was Ulfliot (925), who, though sixty years of age,
proceeded to Norway to obtain a more intimate acquaintance
with the unwritten observances of that kingdom.
Under the direction of Thorleif the Wise, he
obtained in three years the information which he sought;
and on his return to Iceland he promulgated a code
that for many generations regulated the decisions of
the deemsters, or local judges. Its provisions have
unfortunately perished, with the exception of some
inconsiderable fragments. They were no doubt nearly
identical with those which governed the parent country;
but of the latter we have not one in the state
in which it was originally promulgated,—not one
that has not been altered by succeeding legislators.
The spirit of the code which Thorleif himself compiled
at the instance of Hako the Good, can be inferred
only from the general character of Norwegian
society, and from the legal provisions of later times; provisions
which are, in truth, but adaptations of ancient
penalties to an altered state of society. The laws designed
for pagan use would obviously require considerable
modification before they could be adopted by
Christians.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>930.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>To understand rightly the social condition of Iceland
during the pagan and indeed the succeeding ages, too
much attention cannot be paid to the political constitution
and the civil administration of that interesting colony.
The island was divided into four great districts,—viertel;
and over each was a chief magistrate elected
by the people. At certain periods, there was an assembly
of the freemen in each; all had a voice in the deliberations;
all could vote; and the magistrate whom
they had chosen was entrusted with the execution of such
laws, such regulations, as they adopted. But though
comprising one fourth only of the habitable portion of
the island, each of these districts was too extensive to
render the meetings of the freemen so frequent as the
interests of the community required. Hence the sub-division
of each into inferior districts, which had their
meetings for the transaction of such business as was
more peculiarly local. Affairs which concerned the
whole community could be discussed only in the <i>Al-Thing</i>,
or great national assembly, which was held once
a year. The place of meeting was situated on a level
plain, on the shores of the lake of Thingvalle, and was
called <i>the Law Mount</i>. Justice, indeed, was generally
administered on an eminence among all the nations of
Gothic origin; not because there was any sanctity in
a hill, but that the proceedings might be more visible
to the multitude. During eight centuries the Law Mount
continued to be the scene of the national assemblies;
and it is only in our own times that the place of meeting
has been removed to a spot more convenient indeed to
the scattered population, but less hallowed by time.
The president was chosen for life,—an anomaly surely
in a community where the freemen would be thought
equal; but the truth is that among all the Germanic nations
there was a wide difference between the theory and
practice of the constitution. The meanest freeman
present at the Thing might, for any thing we know, have
a vote; he might even have the right of speech; but
still the real power lay in the hands of a few noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>chiefs. What made the authority of this president, this
logsogomadr, or promulgator of the law, the more formidable,
is the fact, that though he was not, as some
writers have contended, a legislator, no laws were made
without his concurrence; and of these he had the interpretation,
no less than the administration. His office
therefore being more than executive, and conferred for
so long a period, made him irresponsible, except when
the Thing was actually assembled. As we have before
observed, Ulfliot was the first who held this dignity.
The laws he enacted were, we are told, preserved for
two centuries by tradition only, before they were committed
to writing. This is not credible. The Runic
art at least was understood many centuries before his
time; and so, we may infer, were the ordinary characters:
at least we read of communication by letter between the
sovereigns and jarls of the time. The more important of
Ulfliot’s laws must have been invested in a dress less
perishable than oral tradition. For ages before his
time, every German tribe with which we are acquainted,
had, besides its common or unwritten, its statute
or written, law; and we know not why Scandinavia
should in this respect be different from such barbarous
tribes as the Saxons, or Finns, or Suabians, during the
same period. On this subject, however, more in the
proper place.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c023'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>6. <i>Greenland</i> owed its discovery to the Icelandic colony.
Towards the close of the tenth century, Eric the
Red, son of Torwald, a Norwegian jarl, who had been
compelled to forsake his country in consequence of a
feud, was, for the same reason, obliged to leave Iceland.
Whither was he to repair? To Norway he could not;
for there were the deadly enemies of his family whom
old Torwald had made. To hide himself in Iceland
was hopeless; and in the Orkneys, which were far distant,
he could scarcely hope to escape the vengeance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>those enemies. He therefore resolved to seek a land of
which some maritime adventurers had obtained a confused
knowledge. Sailing towards the west, he at length
discovered a small island in a strait, which he called
Eric’s Sound, and on which he passed the winter. The
following spring, he examined the neighbouring continent,
which from its smiling verdure—smiling in
comparison with the bleak desolation of Iceland—he
called <i>Greenland</i>. Filled with the importance of this
adventure, he soon returned to that island, and succeeded
in collecting a number of colonists, whom he established
in the newly-discovered land. Yet Greenland was not
uninhabited: better for the settlers had it been so; for
the wild natives were not friendly to men whom they
regarded as intruders on their own domain. Some years
after the settlement of the colony, viz. in 999, Leif, the
son of Eric, repaired to Norway, where he was well
received by the reigning monarch, Olaf Trygveson: Olaf
was soon interested in the description which Leif gave
of the country; and in his zeal for the conversion of all
pagans, he resolved to support the new colony. Whatever
might be the faults of the royal convert, he was the instrument
of much good. He persuaded or forced Leif to receive
baptism, and caused a missionary to accompany him
to Greenland. Hence the introduction of that religion
among the Norwegian colonists; but it had little success
amongst the natives, who, whether from stupidity or vicious
habits, have always been slow to comprehend its truths.
During more than three centuries this infant colony
flourished: the plague of 1348 lamentably thinned its
numbers; and early in the following century the rest
were either exterminated by the savage inhabitants, or
compelled to leave the country. Not a vestige remains
of that colony; nor is it clearly ascertained in what
part of the coast it was located.</p>

<p class='c024'>7. <i>North America</i> (1001–1002). The most curious
part of the present subject is that which relates to the
alleged discovery of North America by a native of
Iceland. Let us state the facts, as recorded by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>ancient sagas, and the authorities followed by Snorro
Sturleson, before we reason upon them.—Herjulf, a
descendant of Ingulf, and his son Biarn, subsisted by
trading between Iceland and Norway, in the latter of
which countries they generally passed the winter. One
season, their vessels being as usual divided for the
greater convenience of traffic, Biarn did not find his
father in Norway, who, he was informed, had proceeded
to Greenland, then just discovered. He had never
visited that country; but he steered westwards for many
days, until a strong north wind bore him considerably
to the south. After a long interval, he arrived in sight
of a low, woody country, which, compared with the
description he had received of the other, and from the
route he had taken, could not, he was sure, be Greenland.
Proceeding to the south-west, he reached the
latter country, and joined his father, who was located
at Herjulfsnæ, a promontory opposite to the western
coast of Iceland.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1001.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The information which Biarn gave of this discovery
induced Leif, son of Eric the Red, the discoverer
of Greenland, to equip a vessel for the unknown
country. With thirty-five persons he sailed from
Herjulfsnæs towards the south, in the direction indicated
by Biarn. Arriving at a flat stony coast, with
mountains, however, covered with snow, visible at a
great distance, they called it Hellu-land. Proceeding
still southwards, they came to a woody but still flat
coast, which they called Mark-land. A brisk north-east
wind blowing for two days and two nights,
brought them to a finer coast, woody and undulating,
and abounding with natural productions. Towards the
north this region was sheltered by an island; but there
was no port until they had proceeded farther to the
west. There they landed; and as there was abundance
of fish in a river which flowed into the bay, they
ventured there to pass the winter. They found the
nights and days less unequal than in Iceland or Norway;
on the very shortest (Dec. 21.) the sun rising at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>half-past seven, and setting at half-past four. From
some wild grapes which they found a few miles from
the shore, they denominated the country Vinland, or
Winland. The following spring they returned to
Greenland.</p>

<p class='c024'>This description, as the reader will instantly recognize,
can apply only to North America. The first of
the coasts which Leif and his navigators saw must
have been Newfoundland, or Labrador; the second
was probably the coast of New Brunswick; the third was
Maine. The causes which led to the voyage, the names,
the incidents, are so natural and so connected as to bear
the impress of truth. And Snorro, the earliest historian
of the voyage, was not an inventor: he related events
as he received them from authorities which no longer
exist, or from tradition. Neither he nor his countrymen
entertained the slightest doubt that a new and
extensive region had been discovered. The sequel will
corroborate the belief that they were right.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1004 to 1008.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The next chief that visited Vinland was Thorwald,
another son of Eric the Red. With thirty companions he
proceeded to the coast, and wintered in the tent which had
sheltered his brother Leif. The two following summers
were passed by him in examining the regions both to
the west and the east; and, from the description in the
Icelandic sagas, we may infer that he coasted the shore
from Massachusetts to Labrador. Until the second
season no inhabitants appeared; but two who had
ventured along the shore in their frail canoes were
taken, and most impolitically, as well as most inhumanly,
put to death. These were evidently Esquimaux,
whose short stature and features resembled those of the
western Greenlanders. To revenge the murder of their
countrymen, a considerable number of the inhabitants
now appeared in their small boats; but their arrows
being unable to make any impression on the wooden
defences, they precipitately retired. In this short
skirmish, however, Thorwald received a mortal wound;
and was buried on the next promontory with a cross at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>his head and another at his feet, a proof that he had
embraced Christianity. Having passed another winter,
his companions returned to Greenland. The following
year Thorstein, another son of Eric the Red, embarked
for the same place with his wife Gudrida and twenty-five
companions; but they were driven by the contending
elements to the remote western coast of Greenland,
where they passed the winter in great hardships. This
adventure was fatal to Thorstein, whose corpse was taken
back to the colony by his widow.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1009.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The first serious attempt at colonizing Vinland was
made by a Norwegian chief, Thorfin, who had removed
to Greenland, and married the widowed Gudrida. With
sixty companions, some domestic animals, implements
of husbandry, and an abundance of dried provisions,
he proceeded to the coast where Thorwald had died.
There he erected his tents, which he surrounded by a
strong palisade, to resist the assaults, whether open or
secret, whether daily or nocturnal, of the natives. They
came in considerable numbers to offer peltries and other
productions for such commodities as the strangers could
spare. Above all, we are assured, they wanted arms,
which Thorfin would not permit to be sold; yet if an
anecdote be true, their knowledge of such weapons must
have been limited indeed. One of the savages took up
an axe, ran with it into the woods, and displayed it
with much triumph to the rest. To try its virtues,
he struck one that stood near him; and the latter, to the
horror of all present, fell dead at his feet. A chief
took it from him, regarded it for some time with anger,
and then cast it into the sea. Thorfin remained three
years in Vinland, where a son was born to him; and
after many voyages to different parts of the north,
ended his days in Iceland. His widow made the pilgrimage
to Rome; and on her return to the island retired
to a convent which he had erected. Many, however,
of the colonists whom he had led to Vinland
remained, and were ultimately joined by another body
under Helgi and Finnbogi, two brothers from Greenland.
But the latter had the misfortune to be accompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>by a treacherous and evil woman, Freydisa, a
daughter of Eric the Red, and who in a short time
excited a quarrel, which proved fatal to about thirty of
the colonists. Detested for her vices, she was constrained
to return to Greenland; but the odour of her
evil name remained with her: she lived despised, and
died unlamented.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1026 to 1121.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Towards the close of the reign of Olaf the Saint, an
Icelander, named Gudleif, embarked for Dublin. The
vessel being driven by boisterous winds far from its
direct course, towards the south-west, approached an
unknown shore. He and the crew were soon seized by
the natives, and carried into the interior. Here, however,
to their great surprise, they were accosted by a
venerable chief in their own language, who enquired
after some individuals of Iceland. He refused to tell
his name; but, as he sent a present to Thurida, the
sister of Snorro Gode, and another for her son, no doubt
was entertained that he was the scald Biorn, who had
been her lover, and who had left Iceland thirty years
before that time. The natives were described of a red
colour, and cruel to strangers; indeed, it required all the
influence of the friendly chief to rescue Gudleif and his
companions from destruction. From this period to
1050, we hear no more of the northern colony established
by Thorfin; but in that year a priest went from Iceland
to Vinland to preach Christianity. His end was
tragical,—a proof that if any of the original settlers
had been Christians, they had reverted to idolatry. In
1121, a bishop embarked from Greenland for the same
destination, and with the same object; but of the result
no record exists. We hear no more, indeed, of the
colony, or of Vinland, until the latter half of the fourteenth
century, when the two Venetians Zeni are said
to have visited that part of the world. From that time
to the discovery of the New World by Columbus, there
was no communication—none at least that is known—between
it and the north of Europe.</p>

<p class='c024'>This circumstance has induced many to doubt of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>facts which have been related. If, they contend, North
America were really discovered and repeatedly visited
by the Icelanders, how came a country, so fertile in comparison
with that island, or with Greenland, or even Norway,
to be so suddenly abandoned? This is certainly
a difficulty; but a greater one, in our opinion, is involved
in the rejection of all the evidence that has been
adduced. It is not Snorro merely who mentions Vinland:
many other sagas do the same; and even before
Snorro, Adam of Bremen obtained from the lips of
Sweyn II., king of Denmark, a confirmation of the
alleged discovery. For relations so numerous and so
uniform, for circumstances so naturally and so graphically
described, there must have been some foundation.
Even fiction does not invent, it only exaggerates. There
is nothing improbable in the alleged voyages. The
Scandinavians were the best navigators in the world.
From authentic and indubitable testimony we know that
their vessels visited every sea from the Mediterranean to
the Baltic, from the extremity of the Finland Gulf to
the entrance at least of Davis’s Straits. Men thus familiar
with distant seas must have made a greater progress
in the science of navigation than we generally allow.
The voyage from Reykiavik, in Iceland, to Cape Farewell,
is not longer than that from the south-western extremity
of Iceland—once well colonized—to the eastern
coast of Labrador. But does the latter country itself
exhibit, in modern times, any vestiges of a higher civilization
than we should expect to find if no Europeans
had ever visited it? So at least the Jesuit missionaries
inform us. They found the cross, a knowledge of the
stars, a superior kind of worship, a more ingenious
mind, among the inhabitants of the coast which is
thought to have been colonized from Greenland. They
even assure us that many Norwegian words are to
be found in the dialect of the people. The causes
which led to the destruction of the settlement were
probably similar to those which produced the same
effect in Greenland. A handful of colonists, cut off
from all communication with the mother country, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>consequently deprived of the means for repressing their
savage neighbours, could not be expected always to
preserve their original characteristics. They would
either be exterminated by hostilities, or driven to amalgamate
with the natives: probably both causes led to
this unfortunate result. The only difficulty in this
subject is that which we have before mentioned, viz.
the sudden and total cessation of all intercourse with
Iceland or Greenland; and even this must diminish
when we remember that in the fourteenth century the
Norwegian colony in Greenland disappeared in the
same manner, after a residence in the country of more
than three hundred years. On weighing the preceding
circumstances, and the simple natural language in which
they are recorded, few men not born in Italy or Spain
will deny to the Scandinavians the claim of having been
the original discoverers of the New World. Even Robertson,
imperfectly acquainted as he was with the links
in this chain of evidence, dared not wholly to reject it.
Since his day, the researches of the northern critics, and
a more attentive consideration of the subject, have
caused most writers to mention it with respect.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c023'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>8. <i>Russia</i> (862). That the Scandinavian pirates
founded a sovereignty in Russia soon after the middle
of the ninth century, is a fact which no historian ventures
to dispute. A body of the people under the denomination
of the Varangians,—a denomination which
nobody can explain,—subdued the Tshuder and other
Slavonic tribes between the Gulf of Finland and Novogrod.
They were indeed masters of the maritime coasts
in this part of the Baltic. At this time Russia was
split into many separate states, which had never known
a common head, and of which most, though of kindred
origin, were at war with one another. Of these states
the most considerable was Novogrod, a flourishing republic,
which had an extensive commerce, not merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>with the nations surrounding the Baltic, but with the
Greek empire, with Persia, and perhaps with India. Its
wealth naturally raised the cupidity of the warlike tribes,
who were on the watch to intercept its merchandise, to
harass its convoys, and, when the opportunity was favourable,
of assailing its outposts. Separately, indeed,
none of these tribes could have made any impression on
that powerful city; but leagues for a common object
distinguished the barbarian no less than the civilised
times. By such a league were the people of Novogrod
menaced; and in accordance with a custom of the times,
solicited the aid of their neighbours, the Varangians.
All the Northmen, and the Varangians in particular,
were ready to sell their sword to the highest bidder.
The offer of the republic, therefore, was promptly accepted;
and her enemies were speedily humbled.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>861 to 862.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>About the fact which we have just related there
is no difference of opinion among historians; but there
is much between native and foreign writers, as to the
circumstances which led to the establishment of the
Varangian dynasty in Russia. According to one of the
former, four of the great tribes, with the city of Novogrod,
being struck with admiration at the wisdom, the justice,
no less than the valour of the Northmen, and rendered
miserable by their continual dissensions, sent an embassy
over the sea for princes that might govern and
protect them! “The interests of order and of domestic
tranquillity,” says the historian already quoted<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c023'><sup>[12]</sup></a>,
“induced them to lay down their national pride:
the Slavi, says a tradition, influenced by the advice
of an aged inhabitant of Novogrod, demanded sovereigns
from the Varangians. Our ancient annals do
not mention this sage; but if the tradition be true,
his name is worthy of immortality, and of a glorious
rank in our fasti.” It seems that the Novogrodians
and the Krivitches were allies of the Finnish tribes on
the borders of the Finland Gulf, and like them tributaries
of the Varangians. Subject for some years to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the same laws, they could easily draw closer the bonds
of the alliance which had formerly united them. Thus,
according to Nestor, they sent an embassy beyond the sea
to the Varangians, saying, “Our country is extensive
and fertile, but we are the prey of anarchy: come then
to govern, to rule over us!” “Three brothers, Ruric, Sineas,
and Truvor, illustrious alike for birth and valour,
consented to assume the reins of government over a
people who did not know how to use the liberty which
their own right hands had won. Accompanied by a large
body of Scandinavians, and prepared to defend by force
of arms their own sovereign rights, these ambitious
brothers for ever abandoned their own country. Ruric
established himself at Novogrod; Sineas at Bielo-Ozero,
amongst the Vessians, or Finnish people; and Truvor
at Isborsk, a town of the Krivichians.” The internal
improbability of this relation, in connection with the
total absence of authority for it, must ensure its rejection
by every critic.</p>

<p class='c024'>The foreign historians of Russia, though relying
on Russian authority, have given the only rational
history of this event. They assure us that, after the three
brothers had assisted Novogrod to humble her enemies,
they were in no hurry to leave the country. Near
the confluence of the Volkhof with the waters of the
Ladoga Ruric built a town, which gave its name to that
lake; and having fortified it, determined to make it
a point of departure for his meditated conquests. His
intention was but too evident to the people of Novogrod,
who began to adopt measures for their defence. The
Varangians were no less eager to profit by their superiority
in arms; and to secure their great object, they
combined their forces, and marched on the city. A
mercantile people are seldom warlike. The inhabitants
loudly expressed their determination to bury themselves
amidst their houses rather than yield; but when the
formidable enemy appeared before their gates, they preferred
the part of submission, and from that moment received
him as sovereign within their walls. Thus was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>republican exchanged for a monarchical government, despotism
for anarchy. Yet Ruric acted with much caution,
and caused the weight of his power to sit as lightly as
possible on the people he had subdued. He established
a council of the chief inhabitants, whom he consulted
for some time in every act of importance; and though
he conferred most of the responsible offices on his own
followers, his sway, at once moderate and firm, was an
advantage to the people. His title of grand prince
illustrates his wide ambition. His two brothers were
princes; so were some others whom he placed over
the local governments; but they were only his vassals,
and their fiefs were reversible to him as their sovereign.
Soon after his elevation, indeed, both the
brothers died; and Ruric incorporated their states with
his own. Both he and they must have been conquerors;
for in a few years his authority extended from the
northern extremity of the Ladoga lake to the western
Dwina, and eastward to the confines of Yaroslaf.</p>

<p class='c024'>But before the death of Ruric the Norman domination
extended even to Kief. Two of his followers,
Ascald and Dir, having apparently some reason for dissatisfaction,
left Novogrod with the intention of doing
what many other Scandinavians had done,—of offering
their swords to the Greek emperor. On their way they
perceived a little town, built on an eminence overlooking
the Dnieper; and on inquiring to whom it belonged,
they were told that it had been founded by three
brothers long before dead, and that it was inhabited by
a quiet inoffensive people, who paid tribute to the
Khozars. The chieftains had a military eye: they
saw at once the importance of such a position; that it
might become the centre of a sovereignty, great perhaps
as that of Novogrod; and with the armed force which
they were leading they surprised the place. In a few
years they were joined by great numbers of their
countrymen, both from that city and from Scandinavia.
This was the period, indeed, when Harald Harfagre
was consolidating his empire by the reduction of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Norwegian chiefs, and securing tranquillity by the banishment
of the more licentious pirates. Thousands and
tens of thousands must, at this period, have left Norway
in quest of new habitations. Hence Kief soon became
very populous, and so confident of its strength that it
sent its piratical sons to the very gates of Constantinople.
Money induced them to retreat. The domination of the
Khozars over Kief was at an end. The introduction of
Christianity into that city did not much assuage the
ferocity of the Normans: many adopted the mass without
forsaking their warrior god.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>882.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The establishment of two empires in Russia was soon
found to be impolitic. After the death of Ruric, and
during the minority of his son Igor, Oleg, to whom he
had confided the administration, resolved to incorporate
Kief with the northern principality. In his way, the
regent took Smolensko and Lubetch; but on reaching
the banks of the Dnieper beneath that city, he saw that
it was too strong to be taken by force, and he had recourse
to stratagem. By a pretended embassy, he
lured the two princes into his power, and put them to
death. The other conquests of Oleg, and his successful
efforts to consolidate no less than to extend the infant
empire, must be sought in the histories of that empire.
Sufficient for our purpose is the fact, that these enterprising
men established in Russia a sovereignty which
still subsists. The family of Ruric held the throne of
that empire above seven centuries; down to the accession
of the present Romanoff dynasty.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c023'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>10. <i>Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Greece, &amp;c.</i>—During
the Pagan age, the Northmen were on the
coasts of all these countries, which they ravaged with
success. Their visit to Italy, however, was but transient.
Hastings, their leader, did no more than surprise
a town at the mouth of the Tiber, and returned to Gaul,
where a richer spoil invited him. In Spain, the Scandinavians
abode for many years. The important city of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Seville was in their power, and from it they made frequent
and most disastrous incursions into the neighbouring
provinces. They were long too powerful to be
expelled by the monarch of Cordova, though that monarch
was no other than the great Abderahman. On
the coast of Galicia too, according to the ancient chroniclers
of Castile, they abode for a season, and caused
much mischief to the subjects of Pelayo’s successors. In
Belgium and Spain their ravages were more frequent
and more severe; in fact, there was no cessation to them
until the north became Christianized. But though
of their predatory expeditions a volume might be composed,
they would little interest the reader, both because
the description of one is the description of all, and because
they left no permanent or important results behind
them. In the expeditions which we have already contemplated,
such results are to be found. In England
they led to the formation of an independent kingdom in
Northumbria, compelled even Alfred to retire into private
life, and eventually placed Danish sovereigns on the
throne. In France they occasioned the dismemberment
of Normandy and Brittany from the crown. In Ireland
they gave rise to many principalities, and continued, for
centuries, to influence in the highest degree the fate of
that country. In the Orkneys, they led to the establishment
of a powerful dynasty, and produced a hardy
race of men who still possess those islands. In Iceland
there was the same result; and Iceland too became,
what to literature is more important,—the refuge of the
Norwegian language, religion, and learning. In Greenland,
they called into existence a colony which subsisted
above three hundred years. In Russia, they laid the
foundation of the greatest empire which the world has
yet seen. Even in North America, transient or unknown
as were the results they produced, they exhibit a phenomenon
as curious as it is interesting,—a handful of
warlike shepherds, or adventurous mariners, traversing
the wide Atlantic, and attempting to introduce their own
institutions among the savages of another world. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>those which were undertaken into the countries before
us were not directed by master minds, and their motive
was only sordid gain. The circumstances, therefore,
which accompanied them may, for any thing we care,
slumber in oblivion.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c023'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>THE TWO EDDAS, THE ELDER AND THE YOUNGER, THE POETIC AND
THE PROSE.—CONTENTS OF THE FORMER.—DIVISION INTO

PURELY MYTHOLOGICAL. 4. THE MYTHIC-HISTORICAL.—POEMS
OF EACH CLASS.—THE PROSE EDDA.—SNORRO STURLESON.</p>

<p class='c026'><span class='sc'>The</span> religion of the ancient Northmen—which, though
it has many points of affinity with other religions, has yet
a sufficient number of its own peculiarities to constitute
it a distinct system—has been always admitted to be a
most interesting and most curious subject of inquiry, not
merely in the north of Europe, but in England, in Germany,
and in France. Yet until the last few years, the
popular notions concerning it were vague and inaccurate;
and for the best of all reasons—that, of the two sources
from which alone a full knowledge of it could be acquired,
the one had been carelessly, the other partially
published.</p>
<p class='c027'>The two works to which we allude are the two Eddas,
the Elder and the Younger; the former attributed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Sæmund, the other to Snorro, the son of Sturlo, both
Icelanders and both Christians,—the one born in the
eleventh, the other in the twelfth century.</p>

<p class='c027'>Sæmund, who, from his varied knowledge, is styled
<i>hin Frode</i>, or the Learned, and by posterity at least was
regarded as a wizard, had greater advantages of education
than we should have expected in an Icelander of
that remote period. He studied, we are told, both in
France and Germany, and is supposed to have visited
Rome. On his return he settled at Oddé, in the
northern part of the island, embraced holy orders, and
was entrusted with the cure of souls. Much of his
time, however, was devoted to the education of youth,
and to literary pursuits. Whether, as Christianity had
not long been established in that remote island, he was
still in some degree influenced by the lingering spirit of
paganism, or whether (a more probable supposition) a
taste superior to the age in which he lived led him to
preserve, instead of destroying, the remaining monuments
of paganism, we are indebted to him for one of
the most curious books that has ever occupied the attention
of the human mind. This was the Elder Edda,
the first part of which was published for the first time
in 1787. The second part did not issue from the press
until 1818, nor the third until 1828. No writer,
therefore, prior to these years, could have any just
notice of this venerable collection of pieces, or, consequently,
of the religion which they illustrate. To
the advantage furnished to the modern student by their
publication must be added the vast erudition of Finn
Magnusen, editor of the third or last part, whose Mythological
Lexicon and Critical Dissertations (especially
the one elaborately devoted to “the Edda Doctrine and
its Origin”) have not only exhausted the subject, but
pointed out many of the affinities between the Scandinavian
religion and that of the most celebrated nations
both in ancient and modern times.</p>

<p class='c027'>The Elder, or Poetic Edda, consists of about forty
poems,—all anonymous, all, with one exception, pagan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>compositions, though written at different periods, the
most recent of them bearing the impress of considerable
antiquity. They have been arranged, perhaps somewhat
arbitrarily, into four different classes, according to
the nature of the subjects. These are—1. the Mystical;
2. the Mythic-didactic; 3. the purely Mythological;
and 4. the Mythic-historical.</p>

<p class='c027'>1. Of the Mystical class, the most prominent is the
<i>Voluspa</i> (Voluspa), the oracle of Vala the prophetess.
This contains a rapid, abrupt, and very dark account of
the whole system, beginning with the creation, and ending
with the destruction of the universe by fire. All
things, however, are not to be destroyed: two individuals,
a man and a woman, are to be saved, and made
the progenitors of a new and fairer world. It should
be observed, that in the Scandinavian as in the Greek
and Roman superstition, superior sanctity is ascribed
to the women. They alone knew the fates; even Odin
had to consult them when he wished to look beyond the
dark cloud that concealed the future from the gods no
less than from mankind.</p>

<p class='c027'>The <i>Grougaldor</i>, or the magical song of Groa, is
another of this class. It consists of terms and precepts,
the use of which is to produce the most astounding
supernatural effects. These “words of might”
were not peculiar to the Odinic worship. They pervade
still more thoroughly that which Zoroaster instituted,
between whom and the northern prophet there
are more points of resemblance than the learned have
yet discerned. Both, for example, pretended to magical
powers, because both found the pretension already in
existence when they entered on their respective careers;
and neither was willing to be thought inferior to the
members of the priestly caste which he undertook to
subvert. The magic of the Finns and Lets Odin stigmatized
as <i>black</i> magic—as inculcated by the powers
of darkness for the injury of mankind; but <i>his</i> was the
white, the pure magic, the kingly art. He found a
school already established in the north; and with all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>his power he could not wholly extirpate it. There
seems, indeed, reason to infer that he connived at
the union of many native rites with his own; or, at
least, that if <i>he</i> did not, his immediate successors did.
Just so it was with the renowned Magian. In contemplating
the origin of his religion, we may either smile,
or be provoked, at the prodigies which every where meet
us. It is a religion of magic; it boasts of supernatural
powers; it openly owns not merely the possibility,
but the necessity, of miraculous results, when the words
of might which it prescribes are duly pronounced. And
if miracles and prodigies constitute its peculiar character
even at this day, in the comparatively civilised
Hindostan, they were doubly necessary when Zoroaster
first announced it to the world. To them he
boldly appealed for the truth of his mission. The miracles
which preceded, those which accompanied, his
birth, may be seen in the elaborate account of him prefixed
by Anquetil du Perron to his translation of the
Zendavesta. Throughout his life, if any faith is to
be placed in his biographers, he wrought, or pretended
to work, miracles by his magical terms. Yet he exceeded
even Odin in the zeal with which he inveighed
against the magic of his rivals. Against the magicians
his most terrible anathemas were hurled; against them
he waged a war of extermination, and justified the hostility
by alleging the express command of heaven. But
they were the servants of Ahriman, the irreconcilable
enemies of Ormuzd—of every thing that is good—of
every thing that issues from the benevolent deity. In
their hands, magic was sure to become an instrument of
evil; but in those of himself and his disciples, it could
not fail to be an instrument of happiness. In the former
case it must be fatal, in the latter highly useful, to human
nature: hence the necessity of destroying in the
one case that which should be piously maintained in the
other. Such, too, was the conduct of Odin. There
was, however, this difference between the two legislators:
while the Median regarded women as absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>impure, and confided the celebration of all his rites, magical
or religious, to the men; the Scythian paid peculiar
honour to the sex: women were allowed, enjoined, to
perform the most solemn, the most awful, ceremonies
of the new faith. Yet the men were not excluded from
the privilege. There were colleges or fraternities of
wizards from the earliest known periods of Scandinavian
history, down to the time of Harald Harfager,
or even later still. Rognevald, a son of that monarch,
was burned to death, with eighty of his associates, on
the charge of exercising a magic condemned by Odin,
and emanating from the evil powers.</p>

<p class='c027'>The <i>Solar Liod</i>, or Song of the Sun, is almost wholly
the composition of Sæmund. But then he derived his
materials from ancient pagan times.</p>

<p class='c027'>2. Of the mytho-didactic poems, the first place may
well be assigned to the <i>Vafthrudnis-mâl</i>. It is, like
many of the other Odinic pieces, in the form of a dialogue.
Odin expresses his resolution to visit Vafthrudnir,
a famous giant or genius, and of contending with
him in science. Frigga, his queen, “to whom the
future is known,” attempts to dissuade him from the
journey, because “no one of the genii is to be compared
with Vafthrudnir in wisdom and valour.” If Odin
should be vanquished in the contest, he must perish,
and with him all the gods who were dependent on
him. But he persists, assumes the disguise of a weary
traveller, and proceeds to the palace of the sage giant.
On this poem, however, we shall not further dilate, as
a translation of it may be found in a volume of the
present collection.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c023'><sup>[16]</sup></a> This contest between the chief of
the gods and the giant is derived from the same
source as the war of the Titans with Jove.</p>

<p class='c027'><i>Grimnis-mâl</i>, or Grimner’s Song, is another of the
mytho-didactic class. Grimner is no other than Odin,
who has assumed the disguise of an aged minstrel, for
a purpose explained by the Icelandic introduction to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>poem. King Rodung had two sons, the one eight, the
other ten years of age. One day they embarked in a
boat to pass some hours in fishing. A storm arising,
they were driven into an unknown sea, and cast upon
a strange coast. Approaching a hut, they were hospitably
received by the master and mistress, who seemed
to be a rustic pair, but who in reality were Odin and
Frigga. Agner, the elder, was the favourite of the
latter, Geirrod, the younger, of the former. In the
hut they remained the whole winter; and when spring
arrived, they were led to the sea-coast, and embarked in
a new vessel which their hosts presented to them. When
bidding adieu, the male rustic whispered something into
Geirrod’s ear. The purport of this secret may be inferred
from the conduct of the prince just as he
reached land. As he leaped on shore, he pushed the
boat away, exclaiming to his brother Agner, “Go,
where the evil genii may seize thee!” Repairing to his
father’s court, he found that father no more, and he was
immediately proclaimed king of the country. On the
other hand, Agner was among the giants or evil genii,
and married to a woman of that hated race. Great,
therefore, was the contrast between the fortunes of the
two; and Odin one day, from the highest heaven,
pointed it out in triumph to his goddess-queen. Frigga
declared that Geirrod was undeserving of the good fortune;
that he was a niggard who starved his dependents
and guests. This the god refused to credit; and
when she persisted in the charge, he assumed a mortal
form to try the experiment. But what man can equal
a woman, either god or goddess, in cunning? Frigga
sent one of her confidential messengers to Geirrod, telling
him to be on his guard against a wise magician then
in his dominions, who had resolved to destroy him:
that magician was to be known by this token—that no
dog would bark at him. The royal command was therefore
given that dogs should be set on all who approached
the palace, and whomsoever they refused to assail
should be brought before him. A man, covered with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>blue peltz, was brought before him and questioned;
but the stranger would return no other answer than
that he was called Grimner. In great wrath, the king
placed him between two great fires—an infallible way
of discovering a wizard—and commanded that he should
receive no food. There he remained eight days and
eight nights, suffering from the heat and from thirst,
when Agner, the son of Geirrod, a boy of ten years, took
pity on him, and presented him with a full horn, observing
that his father did wrong thus to punish a guiltless
man. Here the piece opens: Odin exclaims that
the fire is hot; and prophesies that the royal youth
shall, for this service, soon hold the sceptre of the Goths.
He then proceeds—somewhat oddly, only immortal
beings may be privileged to say or do what they please—to
describe in succession the twelve mansions of heaven.
(To this description we shall afterwards advert, when
we endeavour to explain the cosmogony of the Scandinavians.)
He ended by declaring who he was; and
that the death of Geirrod was at hand. In great fear,
the king arose to release the divine speaker; but stumbling,
the point of his sword entered his body, and
Agner was immediately proclaimed.</p>

<p class='c027'>As many poems on the Edda will hereafter occupy
our attention, we shall only observe that the <i>Alvis-mâl</i>,
or song concerning the dwarf Alvis; the <i>Hyndlu-liod</i>,
or song concerning Hyndla; and the <i>Fiolsvinns-mâl</i>, or
story about Fiolsvinr, are of the same class, and equally
conversant with mythological subjects. The second of
these also mentions the names of some Norwegian jarls
who traced their origin to a divine source. The <i>Hava-mâl</i>,
or sublime discourse of Odin, concludes this class
of poems. It consists partly of moral precepts, some of
which are very good; while others are dictated by a mind
more cunning than wise; and partly of the wonderful
powers attached to certain runes. For the latter we
have no taste; of the former, half a dozen specimens
may be given.</p>

<p class='c027'>“Remain not long a guest in the house of another;
for he who does so becomes a burden to his host.”</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“A secret can be kept by <i>one</i> person only,—by him
whom it concerns. If two know it, there is danger; if
three know it, it is no longer a secret.”</p>

<p class='c027'>“Be thou the friend of thy friend’s friend, and in no
wise the friend of thine enemy’s friend.”</p>

<p class='c027'>“If thou hast a true friend, and keepest nothing
from him, join thy heart with his, exchange gifts with
him, and visit him often. The path untrodden is soon
overgrown.”</p>

<p class='c027'>“If thou hast a friend whom thou canst not trust,
but yet wouldst obtain a benefit from him, speak fairly
to him, but keep thine own secret: return him falsehood
for falsehood.”</p>

<p class='c027'>“Trust not to a woman’s word: her heart is moveable
as the wheel at which she spins, and deceit is cherished
in her breast.”</p>

<p class='c027'>“The child of one’s old age is the most precious.”</p>

<p class='c027'>“Flocks and herds perish; so do friends and kindred;
such will be our own lot. But one thing there is that
will never perish,—the good man’s fame.”</p>

<p class='c027'>3. The poems purely mythological are of a more
interesting class. The <i>Hymis-guida</i>, or song concerning
Hymir, describes an entertainment given by Ægir, the
sea-god, to the deities of the Scandinavian Olympus.
Ægir, to his great dismay, has no cauldron large enough
to brew mead in for such thirsty guests; and Thor
goes to borrow or steal one from the great Hymir.
This entertainment gave rise to another poem, the <i>Loka-glespa</i>,
or quarrelling of Loka with the assembled guests.
It is curious as showing the estimation in which the
gods were held by one of their own number. A more
imaginative production is the <i>Hamars-heimt</i>, or recovery
of Thor’s mallet, which the guests had stolen, and which
Thrym, one of the number, had buried eight miles below
the surface of the ground. The <i>Rafna-galdur-Odins</i>,
or raven song of Odin, describes the lamentations
of the gods at their approaching annihilation.
The <i>Skirnirs-for</i>, or journey of Skirnir to the region of
the giants, in search of a wife for Freyr, one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>gods, is graphic, and strikingly illustrative of northern
mythology. The <i>Vegtams-guida</i>, or Song of the Traveller,
contains the descent of Odin to consult the
charmed prophetess Vala concerning the fate of Baldur.
This piece we have already translated.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c023'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c027'>That most of the preceding poems were composed at
a period lost in the depths of antiquity, and in a region
less remote than Scandinavia from the cradle of the
human race, is exceedingly probable. Such are the
Voluspa, Vafthrudnis-mâl, Grimnis-mâl, Alvis-mâl,
Rafna-galdur-Odins, and Vegtams-guida. In regard
to Hymis-guida, Hamars-heimt, Skirnirs-for, Hyndlu-liod,
&amp;c., they do not bear the impress of so high an
antiquity: they are supposed to be the productions of
the northern muse. They have their interest; but
that interest is much stronger when we read the olden
pieces. These have been compared by a living writer<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c023'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
“to the organic remains, the wrecks, of a more ancient
world; or to the gigantic ruins of Egypt and Hindostan,
speaking a more perfect civilisation, the glories
of which have long since departed.” We see, however,
no reason for assuming this “more perfect civilisation:”
the nation or people who knew such doctrines
might have been ignorant enough, while their priests
were comparatively learned. The oriental impress which
they bear cannot be mistaken; still less can we overlook
the extreme antiquity which they may claim.
Kindred with the most ancient superstitions of Rome,
of Greece, of Persia, they must have been derived from
the same common source.</p>

<p class='c027'>4. Of the mytho-historical poems, there are many.
In them magic is so joined with the ordinary knowledge
of life, the supernatural with the human, that we are
inclined to reject even that which has a real historical
foundation. In this respect, however, they are like the
poems of all heroic ages, and not more censurable than
those of Homer or of Hindostan. A more interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>fact is, that from these lays have sprung most of the
great Teutonic fictions which adorn the Nibelungenlied,
and many even of those which we denominate the romantic
or the chivalric. Probably the incidents are
perversions of real facts, which happened in a period
approaching that of Attila and his Huns, whose exploits
occupy the attention of the northern muse. Some
of them, we know, were sung at the court of Olaf
Trygveson, the Norwegian king. It would not, however,
be difficult to trace others to a higher source
than the age of Attila,—to the source whence the
heroic classical lore of Greece was derived; and others
again bear a marked affinity with the legends of the
Arabian Nights.</p>

<p class='c027'>The prose or younger Edda, usually, but perhaps
erroneously, ascribed to Snorro Sturleson, has also
many of these chivalric or mytho-historical lays.
Of this venerable monument of antiquity the world
could form no just notion prior to the year 1818,
when that admirable scholar professor Rask published
his edition. The edition of Resenius—the only
one previously known to Europe—is an imperfect
work, derived from corrupted MSS. and the notes of
the Scalds are often confounded with the text. It
consists of several parts. The <i>Formali</i>, which is the
introduction, has many legends and fables respecting the
descent of nations, especially of the Scandinavian. They
are evidently from both Asiatic and European sources.
After the introduction, comes the <i>Gylfa-ginning</i>, or
deception of Gylfa. This personage was a king of
Swithiof (part of Sweden) and a famous magician,—the
head of the native magical college which the Aser
were endeavouring to subvert. To account for their
superior power, the result of their superior wisdom, he
determined to assume a disguise, and proceed at once to
the cradle of the Aser in the east. Under the name of
Gangler (the traveller), he reaches the celestial city,
and finds an oracle capable of resolving all his doubts,
of removing all his ignorance. To each of his questions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the reply is in full, explaining the mythology of
the elder Edda, illustrated by extracts from the Voluspa,
the Hava-mâl, and the predictions of the Scalds.
This part of the work is, in its design, and partly in its
execution, so similar to the Vafthrudnis-mâl in the
elder Edda, that it must have been derived from it, or
from a source common to both. The <i>second</i> part of
the prose Edda, called <i>Braga-raedar</i>, contains the
recitation of his best pieces by the divine Braga, at the
banquet of the sea-god Ægir. The <i>Eptirmali</i> is a kind
of epilogue written by Icelandic poets immediately prior
to Snorro, or possibly by Snorro himself. It is an attempt
to explain many of the fables in the Edda, by
the circumstances of the Trojan war. In addition to all
these subjects, we have the <i>Skalda</i>, which is a kind of
<i>ars poetica</i>, for the use of poetical students.</p>

<p class='c027'>While mentioning the prose Edda, we are naturally
drawn to its reputed compiler Snorro, the son of Sturle,
who was also the compiler of the Heimskringla, our
only sure guide for northern history down to the 13th
century. This extraordinary man was born in 1178,
near the bay of Hoams-fiord, on the domain of his
family. He was, consequently, above a century later
than Sæmund, whose birth was between 1050 and 1060.
His descent was illustrious; it could be traced to the
ancient Ynglings and to the jarls of Moria. In his
fourth year he was sent to Oddé, which, as we have
before related<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c023'><sup>[19]</sup></a>, had been the residence of that remarkable
priest; and, strange to say, he was educated under
the direction of Sæmund’s grandson, Jon Loptston.
Here he remained until his twentieth year, and was instructed
in Greek no less than in Roman literature.
The MSS. collections made by Sæmund and Ari Frode,
were his delight; and to them he was indebted for the
ruling bias of his life. In 1197 he left Oddé, and by
marrying the daughter of a rich priest, greatly increased
his patrimonial inheritance. In every thing fortune
smiled upon him; he became in a few years the richest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>man on the island; and when he appeared at the Al-thing,
he was generally escorted by a body of some
hundred horsemen. In 1202, he removed his residence
from Borg, one of his patrimonial seats, to the estate
of Reykholt, which he had also inherited. This place
he fortified—a proof that deadly feuds were common—and
adorned it with works that evinced alike his genius
and his riches. In 1213, he was raised to the dignity
of logsogomadr<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c023'><sup>[20]</sup></a>, or chief judge of the island. No
man could be better qualified for duties, the nature and
origin of which had occupied so much of his time. In
1218 he visited Norway, where he was well received
by king and nobles. His fame, indeed, had travelled
before him. Among his poetical compositions were
some odes in honour of the great; and these, (for flattery
has every where the same effect) procured him
many valuable presents, not only in Norway, but in
Sweden. His sojourn in West and East Gothland doubtless
originated in his desire to collect all the information
which tradition, and possibly MSS., could furnish him
in regard to his ancestors, and the Yngling princes. But
his patriotism seems to have been inferior to his genius.
That he entered into a conspiracy for the complete subjection
of his country to the Norwegian court is certain.
In 1220, both enriched and honoured, he returned to
Iceland; but we no longer perceive in him the great
qualities which had led to his election in 1213. Avaricious,
haughty, revengeful, he made enemies on every
side, and in 1237 was compelled to seek a refuge from
their fury. Again he repaired to Norway, where he
found one of his old patrons, Skule, the jarl, plotting
for the crown of the realm. That plot he favoured;
he even wrote a poem in support of that nobleman’s
claims. Yet he also flattered the king, from whom he
received the title of jarl. But he had designs deeper
than either Skule or the king suspected; and in a short
time some of his intrigues were known to that monarch.
He was forbidden to sail for Iceland; and when he departed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>in defiance of that prohibition, secret instructions
were sent to his son-in-law, Gissur Thorwaldson, to
seize him and send him bound to Norway; or if this
should be impossible, to put him to death. The extremities
to which feuds in a barbarous age may be
carried, are clearly illustrated by the conduct of Gissur.
Though so nearly connected with the historian; though
formerly the most intimate of his friends; he performed
the more atrocious part of the proposal. The great
wealth of Snorro, there can be no doubt, was one inducement
to the deed of blood; but this must have
been inferior to the feeling of vengeance. His measures
required caution, for Snorro was powerful; and to be
prepared, had only to be warned. His design was penetrated
by one of Snorro’s friends, who in a Runic letter
acquainted him with his danger. But this letter the
poet could not understand;—we are told even that he
could not read it; and that all to whom he showed it
were equally unable to decipher it. However this be,
Thorwaldson, marching at the head of a strong body of
men belonging to a clan at deadly feud with his victim,
hastened to Reykholt, where he surprised and murdered
the noble owner, September 22., 1241.</p>

<p class='c027'>Snorro, as we have observed, is the reputed collector
of the prose Edda, and of the Heimskringla. A collector
merely he seems to have been; but he exhibited
great judgment in selecting, arranging, and modernising
the poetic compositions which he followed. For his
history, no less than his mythology, the pagan Scalds
were his authorities.</p>

<p class='c027'>So much for matter purely introductory. From the
two Eddas, assisted by the commentaries of the best
northern scholars, we proceed to lay before the reader
the most striking features of the cosmogony and religion
of the Scandinavians; and to accompany them
by such reflections as may seem necessary to show their
origin and nature.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the Voluspa, or Song of the Prophetess, the
Vala, who is probably Urda, the Norny of the past,
being seated on a high throne, and surrounded by the
deities, acquaints them with the wonders of creation,
and of the destiny reserved for them all,—destruction.
In the Grimnis-mâl<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c023'><sup>[21]</sup></a>, Odin gives a similar account of
the origin of all things; and throughout the elder
Edda, we have allusion to the same doctrines. From
them was derived the relation in the younger or prose
Edda, with the merit of being much clearer. According
to both, there existed in the beginning, on the
site of the world, a vast abyss, Ginnunga-gap, which
contained nothing. But to the north of that abyss
there was another world, called Nifleheim, the cold
and misty. It contained nothing but a spring, Vergelmer,
from which flowed eleven great rivers into the
abyss. They were called Elivagar (the cold waters),
and their streams were poisonous as they were cold. As
they flowed on, owing to the cold they became more
sluggish in their course; so that when they reached the
centre of the abyss, they were converted into ice. Still
they flowed, and still the ice increased, until the whole
Ginnunga-gap was filled. Out of such materials what
could be made? It was necessary to create some other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>power before the visible universe could be formed.
This northern realm, Nifleheim, which contained nothing
except the fountain, which had no quality except that
of coldness, which was covered with darkness, could, of
itself, produce nothing; it could only send the sluggish
poisonous waters into the centre of the abyss. That
these waters were eternal we may infer; but we
cannot infer how long the ice had accumulated when
the real events of creation began. The agent of that
creation is placed in another region, or rather world,
Muspelheim, which lay far to the south of Ginnunga-gap,
and which was intolerably hot,—more hot than
Nifleheim was cold. The origin of this earth and its
inhabitants, therefore, was the work of these two agencies,
heat and cold, operating on the poisonous waters
which lay between them. (Muspelheim, we suppose,
with its numerous fiery inhabitants, and their mighty
chief Surtur, the dark, the incomprehensible, the great
evil principle, had no beginning; or if it had, the Odinian
theologians were unacquainted with it.) What was
frozen by the one influence was thawed by the other.
It was probably some centuries before the heat from
Surtur’s fiery empire dissolved the prodigious mass
into a liquid element. From that element sprung the
giant Ymer, by a process of generation which the northern
sages do not deign to explain; and his vast bulk
filled no inconsiderable portion of the abyss, as will
soon appear from the use made of his corpse. This
giant begat others. How? By a process no less odd
than that which brought him into being. While asleep,
a male and a female sprung from his left armpit; and
he had the felicity too, by rubbing one foot against another,
to produce a son. Why there should be <i>three</i>
ancestors to the Rimthurser, or frost-giants, when, in
our humble notion, two might have sufficed, is another
mystery which we shall not attempt to penetrate. How
were all nourished, seeing that there was no alimentary
substance created? By the Supreme Being, the Great
Alfadur, a cow with four teats was created; and from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>these flowed four rivers of milk. The cow herself was
sustained by licking the salt-rocks, on which the hoar
frost still lay. But her destiny was not fulfilled by this
service; she was to call into existence a new race.
When she had licked one day, the hair appeared; when
she had licked two, there was a head; when three, there
was a complete animal,—a man or giant, named Burè.
This Burè, in his turn, became the father (probably by
marriage with a descendant of Ymer) of Bur, or Bôrr, or
Bore, who was more famous than any of his predecessors.
His son married a lady of the giant race, named
Bestla, and by her had three gods, Odin, Vilè, and Vè.
Before these were long born, they slew the old giant
Ymer. His blood was sufficient to drown all of the
giant race, except Bergelmer and his wife, who sailed
away to the mountains, and became the progenitors of
a new race of giants. The corpse was now cast into
the Ginnunga-gap; and from it heaven and earth were
created. Thus the Grimnis-mâl:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From Ymer’s flesh</div>
      <div class='line'>Was the earth formed;</div>
      <div class='line'>The sea from his blood,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hills from his bones,</div>
      <div class='line'>Plants from his hair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Heaven from his skull;</div>
      <div class='line'>From his eye-brows</div>
      <div class='line'>Formed the mild gods</div>
      <div class='line'>Midgard for the sons of men.</div>
      <div class='line'>But from his brain</div>
      <div class='line'>Were the thick clouds</div>
      <div class='line'>All created.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>This heaven, made from the giant’s skull, was supported
by four dwarfs, East, West, North, South, and
at one of the corners, a living pillar. (What supports
the earth, or the dwarfs themselves, we are not informed).
The globes of fire which ascended from
Muspelheim, and spread through all space, were now
placed by the three gods in the firmament, and made
sun, moon, and stars, to enlighten heaven and earth.</p>

<p class='c024'>That these notions are wild and extravagant will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>asserted by most readers; but do they not involve physical
truths? Were they not invented by the priests
of old to cover their learning from the vulgar gaze?
Let us hear the interpretation of Finn Magnussen, the
most learned, the most acute, though, in too many instances,
the most visionary, of northern commentators.
The giant Ymer, he observes, represents the chaotic
undigested state of the earth, produced by the combined
effects of heat and cold upon water. That water
was the first existing matter, is evident even from holy
scripture. Many nations regarded it as the source of
all things. The opinions of the Greek philosopher on
this subject are well known; but we may mention the
Orphic fragment preserved by Athenagoras. The water
produced mud; the mud produced a monster with three
heads,—the head of a god, of a lion, of an ox. This
monster, which, however, was a deity, laid an egg, the
upper half of which formed the heaven, the lower half
the earth. From the union of heaven and earth, the
offspring were, first the three fates, and then the giants
and cyclops who rebelled, and were eventually cast into
the Tartarean gulf. The Greeks, like all other people,
had seen the mud deposited by water give birth to
animals, after receiving for a time the solar heat. The
action, therefore, of fire on the slimy particles thus deposited,
was received as a generative principle; and assuredly
there is nothing more irrational in the system of Scandinavia
than in that of Greece. The Egyptian system
was conformable with it. An original chaos; the separation
of the mud from the waters; the action of the sun,
or of heat, on the mud; the fermentation which followed;
and the origin of animal existence, are the great features:
as a necessary result, the sun, no less than the water,
was deified. In the Scandinavian, as in the other
systems, some kinds of matter were eternal. Eternal
were the mists of Nifleheim, and the well Vergelmer;
eternal perhaps the abode of Surtur, Surtur himself, and
his fiery spirits. From the beneficent Alfadur nothing
evil was to spring; he, therefore, we suppose, could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>create Muspelheim, or its inhabitants; nor could he
give birth to the giants of the frost, who are emphatically
called wicked: hence their origin from the poisonous
waters of Nifleheim.</p>

<p class='c024'>If, in respect to water and fire, the cosmogony of the
Scandinavians was kindred with that of other people,
the resemblance furnished by the cow was equally
great. “We need not be surprised,” observes Magnussen,
“that men selected the ox, the most useful
and widely-spread animal with which they were acquainted,
for a cosmic symbol in its various forms. The
cow was probably our first nurse; and the oldest
nations, especially the Hindoos and the Egyptians,
regarded her with religious veneration, and called her
the mother of mankind. When men applied poetry to
cosmogony, they elevated a mythic cow to the place of
earth’s mother, or nurse. Such is our Audumbla. And
if the cow was the mother, well may the bull (as in
India) be held the father: he propagated the race, drew
the plough, and in both cases might be said to rear
or nurse mankind.” Among the Persians, the cow
was held in even greater veneration than among the
Scandinavians. The Abudad was the earth, which
Jemsheed (the sun) pierced with his dagger. The cow
was the symbol of creation, the instrument which
Ormuzd employed for the production of the first human
being. A cow, too, received the soul of Zoroaster, and
transmitted it in the form of milk to the father of
the prophet; but the notion was common to most
people. The Cimbri in Italy had their copper ox, on
which they swore, just as the Egyptians swore by Apis.
It was the symbol of heaven, just as the cow was that
of earth; it was held to be the father, just as the female
was the mother, of all. The chariot of Hertha, or mother
earth, was, as Tacitus informs us, drawn by cows.
The Io of the Greeks was probably derived from the
same widely-spread doctrine.</p>

<p class='c024'>The cow, according to Finn Magnussen, is a purification
of the atmosphere in the Scandinavian mythos of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the creation. This, however, is not very clear; nor do
we perceive more justice in the explanation given of
Burè’s origin,—that the licking of the salt-rocks
betokens the emersion of the solid earth from the deep
waters. In another of his analogies, he is whimsical—that
which makes Bôrr, or Bors, to be the Elbors, the
Caucasus of the Persians. A correspondence of names
is, in most cases, purely accidental, and proves nothing.
More rational, perhaps, is our commentator, when he
treats of Odin, Vilè, and Vè, which he makes into air,
light and fire. The three gods destroyed Ymer, that
is, the elements in question destroyed chaos. Whether,
however, he is equally successful in the derivation of
the three words, may be disputed; but there is much
ingenuity, and some plausibility, in all. The Greek
ατμός, the Sanscrit <i>atma</i>, the Teutonic <i>athem</i>, all
signifying air or breath, are certainly cognate; and
they are probably the same with the Othem, or Odin,
or Woden, of the Germans. But whether Odin or
Woden is derived from the Latin <i>vado</i>, to go through,
to pervade, is not so clear. If this etymology were
established, we should have no difficulty in conceiving
Odin to be the air, the breath, the soul of the world.
Still the subject is worthy of consideration; and the
reader may adopt or reject it. He will be less inclined
to admit the derivation of Vilè, which seems far-fetched.
Nor are we quite sure that <i>Vè</i>, akin to <i>Vesta</i>, is to be
taken for elemental <i>fire</i>, or metaphorically for <i>life</i>. Yet
on a subject so obscure, we are unwilling to pronounce
dogmatically.</p>

<p class='c024'>The destruction of Ymer and his offspring, the
wicked giants of the frost, by the divine race, is
evidently the same mythos as the defeat of the Titans
by Jove; of Ahriman and the evil genii, by Ormuzd and
the Amshaspands. Surtur is the Ahriman of Scandinavia.
He is the author of evil, viz., of the giants; and is
destined one day to assist in the destruction of the
universe. We read of the great Alfadur,—another
than Odin who is sometimes called eternal. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>pleasing to read such notions of a First Cause, in such
an age. To this omnipotent, eternal, and beneficent
Being, who is far above all the worlds, inaccessible to
any thing created, there are more allusions than one
in the Edda of Sæmund. Thus the Hyndlu-mâl,
after mentioning the destruction of Odin, with all the
gods:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yet there shall come</div>
      <div class='line'>Another mightier,</div>
      <div class='line'>Although him</div>
      <div class='line'>I dare not name.</div>
      <div class='line'>Farther onward</div>
      <div class='line'>Few can see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than where Odin</div>
      <div class='line'>Meets the Wolf.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Such notions may be regarded as traces of a purer religious
dispensation—of the patriarchal. As an eminent
northern writer elegantly observes<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c023'><sup>[22]</sup></a>—“Thus sounds
the voice of the northern prophetess, the Vala, to us
obscure and indistinct, through the darkness of ages.
It speaks of other times, other men and ideas; if
fettered by the bonds of superstition, it longs after
eternal light, and, though imperfectly, expresses that
longing. We may also recognise some of those mighty
minds of which Pindar speaks, as wandering eternally
over earth and sea. In such sounds heaven and earth
announce an Eternal Being, and at the same time their
own mortality,—truths which no paganism has expressed
more strongly than the Scandinavian. However
darkly, still it does allude to the Mighty One on high,
who is above all the deities of nature,—to one mightier
than the mighty, whom it dares not name,—to that unknown
God whom the Athenians also worshipped.”
We may, however, doubt whether this notion of the
One First Cause, dark as it is, was introduced by Odin
into the north. In most of the relics which the ancient
pagans have left us, we have traces of two religions,
distinct from each other,—both from Asia, but not at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the same period, or from the same region. The worship
of Thor, for example, seems to be much more
ancient than that of Odin; and perhaps before either
was known—before the light of patriarchal truth was
entirely departed from the north—the elementary form
of worship, the most ancient and least debasing of all
superstitions, prevailed.</p>

<p class='c024'>The three gods, Odin, Vilè and Vè, were not the
only created beings. Besides Bergelmer and his wife,
from whom sprung a new giant race, other offspring
than the three deities resulted from the union of Bôrr
with Bestla—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The maid so good and fair</div>
      <div class='line'>Though born of giant race.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>From these sprung all the good, benevolent beings,—gods,
goddesses, elves, Vanir, and spirits of air, of whom
more in the proper place. All these were created before
man. So also were the Duergar, or dwarfs.</p>

<p class='c024'>According to the prose Edda, they bred like maggots
in Ymer’s dead body; but the Voluspa tells us that they
were created by the gods from the blood and bones of
that giant:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then went the gods</div>
      <div class='line'>To their exalted seats;</div>
      <div class='line'>The high and holy</div>
      <div class='line'>Then consulted</div>
      <div class='line'>Of them which</div>
      <div class='line'>Should form the dwarfs</div>
      <div class='line'>From the sea-giant’s blood,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his blue bones.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus Modsogner is</div>
      <div class='line'>The chief become</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the dwarfs;</div>
      <div class='line'>And after him Durin.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>But the former account is preferable, because it
accounts more satisfactorily for the cruel, vindictive,
yet often contemptible character of the race,—a race
with small deformed bodies, large heads, flat noses, and
still more despicable in mind. Probably, as Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Magnussen conjectures, these beings, who could not
bear the light of day; who, if they accidentally saw it,
were changed into rocks; whose life was passed in the
bowels of the earth, especially in the bowels of the
mountains, were intended to personify the subterraneous
powers of nature. Their names, when translated, favour
the interpretation. Wind, Blast, Gleam, Light, Fruit-giver,
Iceberg, and others equally fantastic, attest their
elementary character. Of all beings they were the
most skilful, the most expert, the most industrious:
they were unrivalled smiths; they manufactured
wondrous armour, and other enchanted things, which
were highly prized by the gods, who excelled them in
power, but were inferior in ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c024'>The beings next created were mankind. “The
sons of Bure,” says the prose Edda, “went to the
sea-shore, and found two trees, which they formed
into man and woman. Odin gave them breath and
life; Vilè, understanding and vigour; Vè, beauty of
form, speech, hearing, sight.” But the Valuspa says that
it was Haenir who gave understanding, and Loder a
fair complexion. These, however, may be only different
names for the same beings. Askur was the name of
the first man, and Embla of the woman; the former
signifying an ash tree, the latter, it is said, an elm.
This is evidently a vegetable mythos. It is not peculiar
to the Goths. Hesiod informs us that Zeus formed
the third race of men from ash trees. The ancient
Medians had the same notion; the mythic Kaiamar
died without issue because without mate; but from his
remains in forty years sprung a tree with fifteen
branches; and from it Ormuzd fashioned the first progenitors
of mankind.</p>

<p class='c024'>Midgard, or the middle world, was made for the
habitation of man; but before we describe it, we must
glance at the other worlds with which it was connected.
According to both the poetic and the prose Edda, there
were <i>nine</i>.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>THE NINE WORLDS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>In the Valuspa, the prophetess says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I tell of nine worlds</div>
      <div class='line'>And of nine heavens.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c030'>The giant Vafthrudnis has the same boast; and Alvis,
the dwarf, tells Thor,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>All the nine worlds</div>
      <div class='line'>Have I passed through</div>
      <div class='line'>And every being known.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c030'>These worlds, which were all vertically arranged, except
Utgard, which was on the same plane with Midgard,
are thus specified by Magnussen:—</p>
<p class='c024'>1. <i>Gimlè</i>, the residence of the Supreme Being, the
eternal Alfadur. Connected with it was Liosalfaheim,
the abode of the benevolent light elves (of whom an
account in the proper place). This region is to be the
everlasting abode of the good after the destruction of
the universe.</p>

<p class='c024'>2. <i>Muspelheim</i>, the world of Surtur and his fiery
genii, which lay far below Liosalfaheim. This world
was <i>perhaps</i> uncreated and <i>perhaps</i> will not be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c024'>3. <i>Asgard</i> (Aser-yard), or <i>Godheim</i>, the residence
of the Aser, or gods; the starry firmament, which lay
far below Muspelheim.</p>

<p class='c024'>4. <i>Vanaheim</i>, the residence of the Vanir or spirits
of air: it was also called <i>Vindheim</i>, the home of the
winds. Its position was the atmosphere below Asgard.</p>

<p class='c024'>5. <i>Midgard</i> (mid-yard), so called because it was the
middle world, between Gimlè above, and Nifleheim below.
It was also called <i>Manheim</i>, from its being the home
of men.</p>

<p class='c024'>6. <i>Utgard</i> (outer-yard), or <i>Jotunheim</i>, the home of
the giants, lay beyond the vast sea which, according to
the Scandinavian cosmography, encompasses Midgard.
Midgard and Utgard are horizontal with each other.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>7. <i>Swartalfaheim</i>, the home of the black elves or
dwarfs, the spirits of darkness, is situated in the bowels
of the earth.</p>

<p class='c024'>8. <i>Helheim</i>, the palace of Hela, the goddess of death,
lower far than Swartalfaheim, and the abode of all,
however good, who die a natural death.</p>

<p class='c024'>9. <i>Nifleheim</i>, the world of mist, the lowest of all the
worlds. It contains the poisonous fountain and rivers
in which the bad are to be punished.</p>

<p class='c024'>Of these worlds six are to perish,—perhaps seven,
for there is some doubt as to Muspelheim. The virtuous
are to enjoy an eternity of happiness in Gimlè;
the wicked an eternity of punishment in Nifleheim.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>GIMLE AND MUSPELHEIM</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Defy description. None of the Valas, none of the gods,
none of the giants or dwarfs who boasted of their having
seen these nine worlds, have left us any record of either.
The former, indeed, must have been inaccessible to all
created intelligences; but Liosalfaheim was esteemed
less holy. Why Muspelheim was placed so near to
Gimlè has not been satisfactorily explained; but we
may infer that Surtur and his subjects, ministers of evil
as they were, were only the instruments of the unknown
power. In one account, they are said to be placed there
to forbid the ascent of any hostile foot to the pure
realms so far above them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>MIDGARD AND UTGARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The notion entertained of Midgard by the Scandinavians
was, that it is round; that it is entirely encompassed
by a vast sea; and that at the extremity of this
sea begins Utgard, the abode of the giant race descended
from Bergelmer and his wife. No better description
of Utgard can be given than that which has
been already given in the mysterious voyages of Gorm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and Thorkill.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c023'><sup>[23]</sup></a> We will, however, have frequent occasion
to revert to the same subject.</p>

<p class='c024'>The notion in question was not different from
that of the Greeks. In the time of Homer, the earth
was regarded as horizontal and circular, with the
Mediterranean in its centre; which by one or more
channels communicated with the ocean-stream that
flowed round the land. On the other side of that ocean-stream
was the abode of the Cimmerians and also of the
damned,—a region dark and dismal as that to which the
two Danish navigators, Gorm and Thorkill, repaired.
The heaven too was thought to be solid, supported by
four great pillars, which answer to the four dwarfs of the
Hindoos and Scandinavians. The latter had a bridge
from earth to heaven,—the <i>bifrost</i>, or rainbow, which
though slender, was strong as adamant; and in this they
resembled the Magians, whose sacred books speak of a
similar bridge, most dangerous to pass, between the
earth and the mount of the good genii. The Magians,
too, recognised a dark country to the north, inhabited
by evil genii, whose assaults are continually dreaded by
the deities of the stony firmament. But reverting
to the Greeks, the description which Ælian gives of the
earth, is still more kindred with that of the northern
pagans. “Europe, Asia, and Lybia,” says he, “are only
islands, being surrounded by a great sea; but encircling
the world is a continent of vast magnitude. On it are
to be found huge animals: the men are double the size
of us; and they live twice as long. Some are martial,
and always at war; others so inoffensive and pious, as
to be honoured sometimes by the conversation of the
gods. They have gold and silver in abundance; and
they value gold less than we do iron. A thousand
myriads of them once crossed the ocean, and came to
the country of the Hyperboreans. Near the extremity
of that country there is a place called Avostos, resembling
a large gulf or bay, where it is neither perfectly
light, nor perfectly dark, but where a strong lurid sky
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>hangs down to the earth.” The Arabians had the
same notion of the mysterious country to the north;
and of the giant race which inhabited it,—a race which
is one day to destroy the world.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>ASGARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Asgard, the residence of the gods, deserves a more
detailed description. This vast city, as it is called by
the Edda, was built by Odin and his two brothers immediately
after the death of Ymer. It was well fortified,
to defend it against the Vanir below, and the fiery
sons of Muspelheim above. In it were twelve palaces,
for the twelve chief gods:—</p>

    <div>With Thrudheim, the house of Thor.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>At the first glance every reader must perceive that
by these twelve palaces are meant the twelve signs of
the zodiac; and by Thrudheim the region of the sun.
It could scarcely be expected, indeed, that the Scandinavians
should be ignorant of a system which prevailed
over the whole earth. Like the Egyptians and Assyrians,
and Persians and Hindoos, they divided their year
into twelve parts or months, and placed over each a god.</p>

<p class='c024'>The best description of these abodes is in the Edda,
in the poem of Grimnis-mâl. It is Odin himself, while
between the two fires<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c023'><sup>[24]</sup></a>, that describes them to Geirrod
and Agner. The mere enumeration of these palaces,
and of the divine inhabitants, would be useless unaccompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>by astronomical explanations. To the critical
antiquaries of the north, especially to Finn Magnussen,
must be conceded the honour of having first
penetrated the hidden mysteries of their mythology.
From him chiefly we condense the following account.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Thrudheim.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Thrudheim, or Thrudvangur, the residence of Thor,
the god of thunder, is the atmosphere between Asgard
and the earth. The palace in which the god dwelt was
called <i>Bilskirner</i>, which Ohlenschlager, the modern
Danish poet, thus justly describes:—</p>

    <div>1. <span class='sc'>Ydale.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Uller’s month commenced the Scandinavian year with
the entrance of the sun into Sagittarius, November 22.,
and ended December 21. Uller excelled as an <i>archer</i>,
and he was unrivalled in the art of skating on the ice
and snow: hence he was the god of hunting. He was
the son of the goddess Sif, whose second husband was
Thor; but the name of his father, the first husband,
does not appear. Ydale, his residence, signifies the
dewy valley.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>2. <span class='sc'>Alfheim.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Freyr month commenced December 21., when the
sun entered Capricorn. He was the son of Niord, one
of the Vanir, and produced at the same birth with his
sister Freya. He was the god of the sun,—doubtless
because during this month the days began to lengthen,
that is, the sun to return. In the same manner the
Egyptians honoured their heroes; and from them,
perhaps, the Romans styled the winter solstice “natalitia
invicti solis.” Alfheim, the abode of the light
elves, was given to him for a residence by the gods,
when he cut his first tooth. “He is to be invoked,”
says the Edda, “for peace and a good season: he is the
dispenser of blessings to mankind.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>3. <span class='sc'>Valaskialf.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Liosberi, the light-bringer, which extended from
January 21. to February 19., began when the sun entered
Valaskialf, the residence of Valè, and was sacred to
that god. He was a son of Odin by Rinda (frost), a
personification of the frozen barren earth. He presided
over mid-winter. As the sun was now gaining
power, his festival was celebrated by illumination in
the houses. In imitation of that pagan ceremony, the
Gothic christians had their Candlemas and the feast
of torches. Valè too was an archer, probably from the
rays of the sun, which now shot downwards with greater
force. Valaskialf was said to be white, and covered with
silver,—an allusion to the snowy character of the
month. Valè (also called Bo<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c023'><sup>[26]</sup></a>) slew Hoder the blind
god, who had killed Baldur. This mythos signifies
that the day is beginning to triumph over the night,—for
Hoder is the symbol of darkness. Valentine’s day
fell within the dominion of Valè,—when half the
month was run. Was it derived from this pagan
god?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>4. <span class='sc'>Soequabeck.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The fourth month, sacred to Saga, commenced February
19. and ended March 19. Soequabeck signifies
the deep brook; in allusion, no doubt, to the abundant
rains which fall, and to the snows which are thawed,
at this period, which, in some places, indeed, to this day
retains the name of Fillbrook. Mythologically, Odin and
Saga are said to drink deeply this month. Saga, the goddess
of tradition and history, is here put for Urda, the
norny of the past. The name, however, of the month,
or house, is much more explicit than that of the goddess;
for what has the deep brook in common with
history? The key to the difficulty may, we think, be
found in the fact, that at this period was held the great
assembly of Upsal, when all the freemen who were
able to attend hastened to the temple, and heard the
pontiffs relate the past exploits of the gods; then at
the Al-thing, which was held immediately after the
sacrifices, listened to the explanation of the old laws,
and to the promulgation of new ones, by the judges.
Upsal was the place of meeting for the Swedes: the
Danes and Norwegians had a different place, but at
the same period of the year. On these occasions, the
people took care that the name of the month, Soequabeck,
should be appropriate; for, in imitation of Odin
and Saga, they made the cup pass merrily round.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>5. <span class='sc'>Gladsheim.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Gladsheim, the joyful house, the month sacred to
Odin, carries its own signification with it. From the
20th of March to that of April, was indeed a joyful
season.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>6. <span class='sc'>Thrymheim.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The next month, when the sun was in Thrymheim
(April 21. to May 20.), was called Harpa or Harpen,
alluding probably to the music of the birds at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>season. This sixth house, Thrymheim, had been the
residence of the giant Thiasse, but is now of his
daughter, Skada. On his death, by the hands of Thor,
she was given to Niord, and thus became a goddess.
This mythos may be easily explained. The ancient
summer began with this month. Thiasse, the genius
of winter, is slain by Thor, the thunder god,—for in
the mountainous regions of the north the sound begins
again to be heard. Skada represents the clear, penetrating
wind of spring.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>7. <span class='sc'>Breidablik</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The ninth solar house (May 21. to June 23.), Breidablik,—the
wide-shining, was named Baldur from the
god who inhabited it. An unclouded sun, warm breezes,
and sudden fertility, caused the god to be esteemed the
most beautiful of all the deities; to be denominated the
fair, the bright, the gentle, the good. The mythos of
his death by the hands of Hoder<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c023'><sup>[27]</sup></a>, may be explained by
the gradual yielding of the sun to the encroachments of
night; for Hoder is represented as blind, and is employed
as the symbol of darkness. The nights are beginning
to lengthen, the sun to leave the northern hemisphere:
Hoder, or darkness, is instigated by Loke, the personification
of evil, to encroach on the light. In all the ancient
systems, especially in the Magian, which has so many
points of affinity with the Scandinavian, night is the
characteristic of the evil, just as light is of the good
principle; and the former is always at war with
the latter. The tears of all nature for the fate
of Baldur more strongly illustrate the truth of the
physical interpretation. Even the mistletoe, the instrument
of Baldur’s death, was not chosen without a
meaning; it flourishes when the tree decays; it retains
its verdure throughout the winter: hence it was the
symbol of immortality, while the physical god was
created mortal. When heroes or monarchs died, their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>bodies were burnt: the funeral fire was therefore a
rite necessary to the honour of the dead; and all who
loved him or were dependent on him, were present on
this last solemn occasion. In the mythos, Odin and all
the gods were present: their worshippers, corroborating
the physical interpretation, honoured Baldur on mid-summer
eve by lighting fires on the high mountain tops.
When the Northmen, and we may add, Scotland and
Ireland, received the Christian faith, they still continued
the custom; but now they paid the honour, not
to Baldur, but to St. John, whose festival happened at
the same period.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>8. <span class='sc'>Himmelbierg.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The eighth solar house, <i>Himmelbierg</i>, or the heavenly
mountain, the abode of Heimdal, was so called
because the sun was now at its height. Himmelbierg,
being the highest of all the palaces, was well adapted
for watching; hence Heimdal was the watchman of the
gods; and from his elevated situation he looked out
upon the whole universe. His golden teeth, his golden-maned
horse, his appellation “the whitest and brightest of
the Aser,” are but so many expressions for the unusual
splendour of the sun at this season (June 23. to July 23).
Another of his epithets, the <i>declining</i>, alluding to the declination
of the sun in the heavens, is equally explanatory
of the mythos. Heimdall, says the Edda, needs less sleep
than a bird; an allusion to the extreme shortness of the
nights in northern countries at the summer solstice. He
can see as well, it adds, by night as by day,—meaning
that, at this season, there is no such thing as darkness,
properly so called. His hearing, too, is equally acute:
not even the growth of the grass, or of wool on the
sheep’s back, escaped him. This may denote the silence
of all nature during the great heat, and especially during
the night.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>9. <span class='sc'>Folkvangur.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The sun careered through Folkvangur, from July 23.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>to August 23. The word means a meeting of people
in the field, alluding most evidently to the harvest
labours during this season. Hence, Freya was considered
the goddess of fertility, and, figuratively, of love.
An extension of the same figure rendered her the
goddess of the night,—of the moon,—of the planet
Venus.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>10. <span class='sc'>Glitner.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Glitner, the tenth house (August 23. to September
23.), was ruled by the god Forsete, which means
the <i>fore-sitter</i>, the president. Every year this deity
held a <i>Thing</i> at the will of Urda, the norny of the
past; and there he decided all controversies so justly
that every party was satisfied. Forsete, therefore, was
the god of justice. On earth, too, in imitation of the
mythical proceedings above, a great judicial assembly,
or Al-thing, was held at this season. During its continuance,
and indeed during the whole time of harvest,
all feuds were suspended; hence the satisfaction of all
with his authority.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>11. <span class='sc'>Noatun.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Noatun was the abode of Niord, and the eleventh
great solar house (September 23. to October 23). Niord
(of whom more hereafter) was a prince of the Vanir,
but was admitted among the gods. He was lord of
the winds, and consequently of the sea, which is governed
by them. Noatun, his residence, was said to lie
near the sea-shore, but higher in the clouds. He
was the beneficent deity of the sea, while Ægir and
Ram were the terrible deities of the same element.
The meaning is, that though in this month the winds
were high, they were not destructive to ships.</p>

<p class='c024'>Landvide, the twelfth solar house, means empty or
barren land,—a term descriptive enough of the earth
at this season. As this is the last of the months so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Vidar, the presiding deity, is to outlive the rest of the
gods, and to revenge the death of his father Odin on
the wolf Fenris.</p>

<p class='c024'>Such were the divine palaces of Asgard. But that
great world had other parts, which require a moment’s
notice. Three of them belonged to Odin:—Gladsheim
was the great palace or hall where he presided over
the twelve diar, or judges, who administered the affairs
of Asgard. Valaskialf, the palace of his son Valè, was
also his own. The highest part of this dwelling was
called Lidskialf, where he had a throne, and which was
so elevated that he could see all the dwellers upon earth.
But more celebrated than these, or all his other abodes,
was <i>Valhalla</i>.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Easily can they</div>
      <div class='line'>Who come to Odin</div>
      <div class='line'>Perceive and know Valhall.</div>
      <div class='line'>The roof is decked with spears,</div>
      <div class='line'>The walls covered with shields,</div>
      <div class='line'>The benches with helmets.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>This was the great hall in which Odin entertained
the Einheriar, or souls of the warriors slain in battle.
Like the palace of Thor, it had 540 gates. Daintily
were they fed on the boar Schrimner, which though
killed and eaten every day, was always alive again in
the evening. Andrimner, the best cook in the world,
prepared the meal. As for the mead, without which in
profusion no northern feast would have been esteemed,
abundance of it was furnished by the goat Heidrun.
Never had guests a more liberal host. He treated them
thus, that when the dreaded twilight of the gods arrived,
they might assist him in repelling the giants and the
spirits of fire. Nor would he allow them to forget
their martial exercises. Early each morning they are
awakened by the crowing of the cock with the golden
comb,—that cock which is doomed also to warn the
gods when the last enemy approaches. Hastily assuming
their vizors, 800 of them issued at each of the 540
gates, so that the god had nearly half a million of boon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>companions. The whole of the time from sunrise to
the hour of dinner was passed in fighting; and with
such hearty good will, that multitudes were prostrated;
but when the great hour arrived, all rose, perfectly well,
to contend over the cups as strenuously as they had
done in the field. They were served by the Valkyrs,
viz., the choosers of the slain,—goddesses who were
the favourite messengers of Odin, and the only females
admitted into Valhalla.</p>

<p class='c024'>The way in which a hero, who died in battle, or
marked his bosom with runes to Odin, left Midgard for
Valhalla, is poetically described. Thus shortly after
his burial, king Hako, in his silent mound, first changed
his posture from the supine to the sitting. He grasped
his sword in his right hand; his shield with his left;
while the celestial gold-hoofed courser, which had been
sent to convey him, pawed the ground outside with
manifest impatience. The mound opens; the monarch
rises, mounts the noble horse, gallops up Vifrost, and
passes through Gladsheim into Valhalla, where the gods
came forward to meet him; while Braga, the deity of
song, sounds the celestial harp with his praises.</p>

<p class='c024'>We have seen the pursuits of the Einheriar by day,—fighting
and drinking. Did they sleep? So we suppose.
Sometimes, however, they mounted their horses,
galloped down Vifrost, and entered their sepulchral
mounds. Sometimes, too, they were present in battle;
at other times they communed with their mortal friends.</p>

<p class='c024'>The blood-thirsty character of the Northmen, which
could not enjoy peace without cutting one another to
pieces, has been justly exposed by historians. Still,
however valour might be esteemed, we would not assert
that it was the only virtue in the mind of the Scandinavians,
or that heaven was closed to every other. There
is, indeed, room to infer that this tenet was confined
merely to a sect,—a caste,—the dominant one,—the
immediate followers of Odin.</p>

<p class='c024'>As we shall have frequently to speak of these celestial
residences in the course of this chapter, we shall only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>add that Asgard had another palace called Vingolf,
where the Asyniar, or goddesses, met, just as the gods
met in Valhalla.</p>

    <div>SWARTALFAHEIM</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Was the abode of the Black Elves, (to distinguish them
from the Light or shining Elves, who dwelt in Loisalsfaheim,)
and also of the Dwarfs.</p>
<p class='c024'>But there were elves who dwelt in the air, in water,
amongst the trees. These could not be called underground
people; and it is almost doubtful whether they
can be classed among the Black Elves. As the term,
however, has been adopted for the purpose we have indicated,
viz., to distinguish the elves of earth from those
of the highest heaven,—both those who dwell <i>on</i>, and
those who dwell <i>below</i>, the earth’s surface—the well
and the ill disposed—may here be considered.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Our heathen forefathers,” says Thorlacius<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c023'><sup>[28]</sup></a>, “believed,
like the Pythagoreans—and the farther back in
antiquity the more firmly—that the whole world was
filled with spirits of various kinds, to whom they
ascribed in general the same nature and properties as the
Greeks did to their Dæmons. These were divided into
the celestial and the terrestrial, from their places of
abode. The former were, according to the ideas of
those times, of a good and elevated nature, and of a
friendly disposition towards men, whence they also received
the name of White or Light Alfs, or spirits.
The latter, on the contrary, who were classified after
their abodes in the air, sea, and earth, were not regarded
in so favourable a light. It was believed that
they, particularly the <i>land ones</i>, the <i>δαίμονες ἐπιχθόνιοι</i>
of the Greeks, constantly and on all occasions sought to
torment or injure mankind, and that they had their
dwelling partly on the earth in great and thick woods,
whence came the name Skovtrolde<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c023'><sup>[29]</sup></a> (Wood-Trolds); or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>in other desert and lonely places, partly in and under
the ground, or in rocks and hills: these last were called
Bjerg-Trolde (Hill Trolds); to the first, on account of
their different nature, was given the name of Dverge
(Dwarfs), and Alve, whence the word Ellefolk, which
is still in the Danish language. These Dæmons, particularly
the underground ones, were called Svartalfar,
that is, Black Spirits, and inasmuch as they did mischief,
Trolls.”</p>

<p class='c024'>The prose Edda draws a broad distinction between
the light and the black elves,—the former being whiter
than the sun; the latter darker than pitch.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Of the origin of the word Alf,” says Mr. Keightley,
“nothing satisfactory is to be found. Some think it is akin
to the Latin <i>albus</i>, white; others to <i>alpes</i>, Alps mountains.
There is supposed to be some mysterious connection
between it and the word Elf or Elv, signifying water in
the northern languages; an analogy which has been
thought to correspond with that between the Latin Nympha
and Lympha. Both relations are perhaps rather fanciful
than just. Of the derivation of Alf, as just observed,
we know nothing certain<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c023'><sup>[30]</sup></a>; and the original meaning
of Nympha would appear to be, a new-married woman<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c023'><sup>[31]</sup></a>,
and thence a marriageable young woman; and it was
applied to the supposed inhabitants of the mountains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>seas, and streams, on the same principle that the
northern nations gave them the appellation of men and
women, that is, from their imagined resemblance to the
human form.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Whatever its origin, the word Alf has continued
till the present day in all the Teutonic languages.
The Danes and Swedes have their Ellen or Elven Dan,
and Elfvor Swed (Elvus), and the words Elf-dans and
Elf-blæst, together with Olof and other proper names,
are derived from it. The Germans call the nightmare
<i>Alp</i>; and in their old poems we meet <i>Elben</i> and
<i>Elbinnen</i>, male and female elves, and <i>Elbisch</i> frequently
occurs in them in the bad sense of the “Elvish”
of Chaucer and our old romancers, and a number of
proper names, such as Alprecht, Alpine, Alpwin, &amp;c.,
were formed from it; undoubtedly before it got its
present ill sense. In the Anglo-Saxon Ælf, with its
feminine and plural, frequently occurs. The Orcades,
Naiades, and Hamodryades of the Greeks and Romans
are rendered in an Anglo-Saxon Glossary by munt-ælfenne,
fæ-ælfenne, and feld-ælfenne. Ælf is a
component part of the proper names Ælfred and Ælfric;
and the author of the poem of ‘Judith’ says that his
heroine was Ælf-scīene (Elf-sheen), bright as an Elf.
But of the character and acts of the Elfs no traditions
have been preserved in Anglo-Saxon literature. In the
English language, Elf, Elves, and their derivatives, are
to be found in every period, from its first formation
down to this present time.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c023'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>The judicious and indefatigable writer whom we have
followed in the preceding extract, and who has treated
the subject with a minuteness and an accuracy unequalled
in this country, continues:—</p>

<p class='c024'>“The Alfar still live in the memory and traditions
of the peasantry of Scandinavia. They also, to a
certain extent, retain their distinction into white and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>black. The former, or the good elves, dwell in the air,
dance on the grass, or sit in the leaves of trees; the
latter, or evil elves, are regarded as an underground
people, who frequently inflict sickness or injury on
mankind; for which there is a particular kind of
doctors, called Kloka, to be met in all parts of the
country.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The elves are believed to have their kings, to celebrate
their weddings and banquets, just the same as the
dwellers above ground. There is an interesting intermediate
class of them in popular tradition, called the
Hill-people (Högfolk), who are believed to dwell in
caves and small hills: when they show themselves they
have a handsome human form. The common people
seem to connect with them a deep feeling of melancholy,
as if bewailing a half-quenched hope of redemption.</p>

<p class='c024'>“There are only a few old persons who now can tell
any thing more about them than of the sweet singing
that may occasionally on summer nights be heard out
of their hills, when one stands still and listens, or, as it
is expressed in the ballads, <i>lays his ear to the Elve-hill</i>
(lägger sitt öra till Elfvehögg): but no one must be so
cruel as, by the slightest word, to destroy their hopes
of salvation, for then the sprightly music will be turned
into weeping and lamentation.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The Norwegians called the Elves, Huldrafolk, and
their music, Huldraslaat: it is in the minor key, and of
a dull and mournful sound. The mountaineers sometimes
play it, and pretend they have learned it by
listening to the underground people among the hills and
rocks. There is also a tune called the Elf-king’s tune,
which several of the good fiddlers know right well, but
never venture to play; for as soon as it begins, both
old and young, and even inanimate objects, are impelled
to dance, and the player cannot stop unless he can play
the air backwards, or that some one comes behind him
and cuts the strings of his fiddle.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The little underground Elves, who are believed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>dwell under the houses of mankind, are described as
sportive and mischievous, and as imitating all the
actions of men. They are said to love cleanliness
about the house and place, and to reward such servants
as are neat and cleanly.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The Elves are extremely fond of dancing in the
meadows, where they form those circles of a livelier
green which from them are called Elfdans (Elfdance):
when the country people see in the morning stripes
along the dewy grass in the woods and meadows, they
say the Elves have been dancing there. If any one
should at midnight get within their circle, they become
visible to him, and they may then illude him. It is
not every one that can see the Elves; and one person
may see them dancing, while another perceives nothing.
Sunday children, as they are called, <i>i.e.</i>, those born on
Sunday, are remarkable for possessing this property of
seeing Elves and similar beings. The Elves, however,
have the power to bestow this gift on whomsoever they
please. They also used to speak of Elf-books, which
they gave to those whom they loved, and which enabled
them to foretell future events.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The Elves often sit in little stones that are of a
circular form, and are called Elf-mills (Elf-quärnor);
the sound of their voice is said to be sweet and soft, like
the air.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The Danish peasantry give the following account
of their Ellefolk or Elve-people:</p>

<p class='c024'>“The Elle-people live in the Elle-moors. The appearance
of the man is that of an old man, with a low-crowned
hat on his head: the Elle-woman is young,
and of a fair and attractive countenance, but behind she
is hollow like a dough-trough. Young men should be
especially on their guard against her, for it is very
difficult to resist her; and she has, moreover, a stringed
instrument, which, when she plays on it, quite ravishes
their hearts. The man may be often seen near the
Elle-moors, bathing himself in the sunbeams; but if any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>one comes too near him, he opens his mouth wide and
breathes upon them, and his breath produces sickness
and pestilence. But the women are most frequently to
be seen by moonshine; then they dance their rounds
in the high grass so lightly and so gracefully, that they
seldom meet a denial when they offer their hand to a
rash young man. It is also necessary to watch cattle,
that they may not graze in any place where the Elle-people
have been; for if any animal come to a place
where the Elle-people have spit, or done what is worse,
it is attacked by some grievous disease, which can only
be cured by giving it to eat a handful of St. John’s
wort, which had been pulled at twelve o’clock on St.
John’s night. It might also happen that they might
sustain some injury by mixing with the Elle-people’s
cattle, which are very large, and of a blue colour, and
which may sometimes be seen in the fields licking up
the dew on which they live. But the farmer has an
easy remedy against this evil; for he has only to go to
the Elle-hill when he is turning out his cattle, and to
say, ‘Thou little Trold! may I graze my cows on thy
hill?’ And if he is not prohibited, he may set his
mind at rest.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c023'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>Of the Scandinavian <i>Dwarfs</i> much less is known by
the general reader.</p>

<p class='c024'>“These diminutive beings, dwelling in rocks and
hills, and distinguished for their skill in metallurgy,
seem to be peculiar to the Gothic mythology. Perhaps
the most probable account of them is, that they are
personifications of the subterraneous powers of nature;
for it may be again observed, that all the parts of every
ancient mythology are but personified powers, attributes,
and moral qualities. The Edda thus describes their
origin:—</p>

<p class='c024'>“‘Then the gods sat on their seats, and held a
council, and called to mind how the Duergar had become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>animated in the clay below in the earth, like
maggots in flesh. The Duergar had been first created,
and had taken life in Ymer’s flesh, and were maggots
in it, and by the will of the gods they became partakers
of human knowledge, and had the likeness of men,
and yet they abode in the ground and in stones. Modsogner
was the first of them, and then Dyrin.’</p>

<p class='c024'>“The Duergar are described as being of low stature,
with short legs and long arms, reaching almost down to
the ground when they stand erect. They are skilful
and expert workmen in gold, silver, iron, and other
metals. They form many wonderful and extraordinary
things for the Æser, and for mortal heroes, and the
arms and armour that come from their forges are not
to be paralleled. Yet the gift must be spontaneously
bestowed, for misfortune attends those extorted from
them by violence.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c023'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>Two narratives of undoubted antiquity will illustrate
the cunning of these subterraneous workmen. They
are, however, somewhat out of place, since they would
better suit the following section.</p>

<p class='c024'>The first is from the Edda:—</p>

<p class='c024'>“Loke, the son of Laufeiar, had out of mischief cut
off all the hair of Sif. When Thor found this out, he
seized Loke, and would have broken every bone in his
body, only that he swore to get the Suartalfar to make
for Sif hair of gold, which would grow like any other
hair.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Loke then went to the Dwarfs that are called the
sons of Ivalldr. They first made the hair, which as
soon as it was put on the head grew like natural hair;
then the ship Skidbladnor<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c023'><sup>[35]</sup></a>, which always had the wind
with it, wherever it would sail; and, thirdly, the spear
Gugner, which always hit in battle.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Then Loke laid his head against the Dwarf Brock,
that his brother Eitri could not forge three such valuable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>things as these were. They went to the forge;
Eitri set the swine-skin (bellows) to the fire, and bid
his brother Brock to blow, and not to quit the fire
till he should have taken out the things he had put
into it.</p>

<p class='c024'>“And when he was gone out of the forge, and that
Brock was blowing, there came a fly and settled upon
his hand, and bit him; but he blew without stopping
till the smith took the work out of the fire; and it was
a boar, and its bristles were of gold.</p>

<p class='c024'>“He then put gold into the fire, and bid him not to
stop blowing till he came back. He went away, and
then the fly came and settled on his neck, and bit him
more severely than before; but he blew on till the
smith came back and took out of the fire the gold ring
which is called Drupner.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Then he put iron into the fire, and bid him blow,
and said that if he stopped blowing all the work would
be lost. The fly now settled between his eyes, and bit
so hard that the blood ran into his eyes, so that he
could not see; so when the bellows were down he
caught at the fly in all haste, and tore off its wings;
but then came the smith, and said that all that was in
the fire had nearly been spoiled. He then took out of
the fire the hammer Miölner, and gave all the things
to his brother Brock, and bade him go with them to
Asgard and settle the wager.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Loke also produced his jewels, and they took Odin,
Thor, and Freyr, for judges. Then Loke gave to Odin
the spear Gugner, and to Thor the hair that Sif was to
have, and to Freyr Skidbladnor, and told their virtues
as they have been already related. Brock took out his
jewels, and gave to Odin the ring, and said that every
ninth night there would drop from it eight other rings
as valuable as itself. To Freyr he gave the boar, and
said that he would run through air and water, by
night and by day, better than any horse, and that never
was there night so dark that the way by which he went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>would not be light from his hide. He gave the hammer
to Thor, and said that it would never fail to hit a
Troll, and that at whatever he threw it, it would never
miss it; and that he could never fling it so far that it
would not of itself return to his hand; and when he
chose, it would become so small that he might put it
into his pocket. But the fault of the hammer was,
that its handle was too short.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Their judgment was, that the hammer was the
best, and that the Dwarf had won the wager. Then
Loke prayed hard not to lose his head; but the Dwarf
said that could not be. ‘Catch me, then,’ said Loke;
and when he went to catch him, he was far away; for
Loke had shoes with which he could run through air
and water. Then the Dwarf prayed Thor to catch him,
and Thor did so. The Dwarf now went to cut off his
head; but Loke said he was to have the head only, and
not the neck. Then the Dwarf took a knife and a
thong, and went to sew up his mouth; but the knife
was bad, so the Dwarf wished that his brother’s awl were
there; and as soon as he wished it, it was there, and
he sewed his lips together.”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c023'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>The physical interpretation of this mythos is entitled
to some attention. Sif is a personification of the earth,
“the wife of Thor, the heaven or atmosphere: her
hair is the trees, bushes, and plants, that adorn the
surface of the earth. Loke is the fire-god, that delights
in mischief, <i>bene servit, male imperat</i>. When by immoderate
heat he has burned off the hair of Sif, her
husband compels him so by temperate heat to warm the
moisture of the earth, that its former products may
spring up more beautiful than ever. The boar is given
to Freyr, to whom and his sister Freya, as the gods of
animal and vegetable fecundity, the northern people
offered that animal, as the Italian people did to the
earth. Loke’s bringing the gifts from the underground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>people, seems to indicate a belief that metals
were prepared by subterranean fire; and perhaps the
forging of Thor’s hammer, the mythic emblem of
thunder, by a terrestrial demon, on a subterranean
anvil, may suggest that the natural cause of thunder is
to be sought in the earth.”</p>

<p class='c024'>The next illustration is from the Heimskringla of
Snorro:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THORSTON AND THE DWARF.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>“When spring came, Thorston made ready his ship,
and put twenty-four men on board of her. When they
came to Vinland, they ran her into a harbour, and
every day he went on shore to amuse himself.</p>

<p class='c024'>“He came one day to an open part of the wood,
where he saw a great rock, and out a little piece from
it a Dwarf, who was horridly ugly, and was looking up
over his head, with his mouth wide open; and it appeared
to Thorston that it ran from ear to ear, and that
the lower jaw came down to his knees. Thorston
asked him why he was acting so foolishly. ‘Do not
be surprised, my good lad,’ replied the Dwarf; ‘do
you not see that great dragon that is flying up there?
He has taken off my son, and I believe that it is Odin
himself that has sent the monster to do it. But I shall
burst and die if I lose my son.’ Then Thorston shot
at the dragon, and hit him under one of the wings, so
that he fell dead to the earth; but Thorston caught the
Dwarf’s child in the air, and brought him to his father.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The Dwarf was exceeding glad, and was more rejoiced
than any one could tell; and he said, ‘A great
benefit have I to reward you for, who are the deliverer
of my son; and now choose your recompense in gold
and silver.’ ‘Cure your son,’ said Thorston, ‘but
I am not used to take rewards for my services.’ ‘It
were not becoming,’ said the Dwarf, ‘if I did not
reward you; and let not my shirt of sheep’s-wool, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>I will give you, appear a contemptible gift, for you will
never be tired when swimming, or get a wound, if you
wear it next your skin.’</p>

<p class='c024'>“Thorston took the shirt and put it on, and it fitted
him well, though it had appeared too short for the
Dwarf. The Dwarf now took a gold ring out of his
purse, and gave it to Thorston, and bid him to take good
care of it, telling him that he never should want for
money while he kept that ring. He next took a black
stone, and gave it to Thorston, and said, ‘If you hide
this stone in the palm of your hand, no one will see you.
I have not many more things to offer you, or that would
be of any value to you; I will, however, give you a
fire-stone for your amusement.’</p>

<p class='c024'>“He then took the stone out of his purse, and with
it a steel point. The stone was triangular, white on
one side, and red on the other, and a yellow border ran
round it. The Dwarf then said, ‘If you prick the
stone with the point in the white side, there will come
on such a hail-storm that no one will be able to look at
it; but if you want to stop this shower, you have only
to prick on the yellow part, and there will come so
much sunshine that the whole will melt away. But if
you should like to prick the red side, then there will
come out of it such fire, with sparks and crackling, that
no one will be able to look at it. You may also get
whatever you will by means of this point and stone,
and they will come of themselves back to your hand
when you call them. I can now give you no more such
gifts.’</p>

<p class='c024'>“Thorston then thanked the Dwarf for his presents,
and returned to his men, and it was better for him to
have made this voyage than to have stayed at home.”</p>

it.</p>

<p class='c024'>Such were the worlds of the pagan Northmen. But
before we dismiss this part of our subject, we must
advert for a moment to one of more philosophical
import,—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE YGGDRASIL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>As this is to us at least a mysterious subject (we do
not pretend to the faculty of “looking through a millstone”),
we shall present it to the reader in the words
of Magnussen, and an able critic of our own country.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The principal and most holy place of the gods is
at the ash Yggdrasil. This ash is the largest and best
of all trees. Its branches spread over the whole world,
and reach up over the heaven. The tree has two roots,
which extend widely; the one to the Aser, the other to
the Frost-giants, where before was Ginnunga-gap; the
third stretches over Nifleheim, and by it is Hvergelmer
(the abyss), where (the Snake-king) Nidhug gnaws the
root beneath.</p>

<p class='c024'>“By the other root, which extends to the Frost-giants,
is Mimer’s well, wherein Wisdom and Understanding
lie concealed. Mimer, the owner of the well,
is full of wisdom; for every morning he drinks from
the well out of the Giallar horn. Once came All-Father
(Odin) thither, and sought a drink from the
well, but attained not his wish, till he gave his eye as a
pledge. As it is said, in the Völuspá:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘All know I, Odin,</div>

<p class='c021'>“By the third root of the ash, which extends to
heaven, is the Urdar-fount. By the fount stands a fair
dwelling, out of which go the three maids, Urda, Verande,
and Skuld. These maids appoint the lifetime
of all men, and are called Nornir. Of them, saith the
Vala:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“The Nornir, who dwell by the Urdar-fount, take
each day water from the well, and with it and the mud
that is about the well, sprinkle the ash-tree, that its
branches may not rot or wither. This water is so holy,
that every thing that comes into the well becomes as
white as the membrane within an egg-shell. So it is
said in the Völuspá,</p>

seeks to set strife between the eagle and the Snake-king
Nidhug. Four harts run about in the branches of the

<p class='c021'>“The mythos of Yggdrasil is contained in the preceding
passages; and northern mythologists in general,
and Magnussen in particular, have been no where more
fortunate than in their explanation of it. Yggdrasil,
they say, represents the universe (rather the world);
its three roots lie in the three portions into which, according
to the system of the devisers of Yggdrasil, the
universe is divided. The central root is in Niflheim,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the dark and dismal abyss beneath the earth, and is
watered by Hvergelmer (the Ancient Cauldron), and
its stem runs up through the earth to the summit of
heaven. The second root is by Mimer’s well, in the
north, the abode of the Frost-giants. The third root
is by the Urdar-fount, in the bright and warm south,
whose waters the three Maids, <i>i.e.</i> Time Past, Present,
and Future, cast over its foliage to keep it in perpetual
verdure. The branches are the æther, their leaves the
clouds, the clusters of keys the constellations; the four
harts are the four winds, the eagle denotes the air, the
hawk the still æther, the squirrel the snow-flakes, hail-stones,
and rain-drops. Urda’s fount, <i>i.e.</i> the fount
of Destiny, is the source of life, light, and warmth;
the snow-white swans, which swim on its waters, represent
the sun and moon. The mythos of Mimer’s well
shows the descent of the sun (<i>Odin’s eye</i>) into the sea
each evening, where, during the night, he learns wisdom
from the owner of the well; the golden-hued mead
which Mimer drinks each morning, is the ruddy dawn
that daily flows out over the sky before the sun.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c023'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>There can be no doubt that two distinct systems of
creation are embraced by these mythi. They could not
have originated in the same people. The Ymerian,
there is strong reason to believe, was the <i>native</i>, the
Yggdrasil the <i>foreign</i>, system.</p>

<p class='c024'>From the preceding sketch of the Scandinavian universe,
we perceive that it was inhabited by many
distinct races of inhabitants. With one slight alteration,
they may be classified after the nine worlds:—</p>

<p class='c032'>1. The Shining Elves of Liosalfaheim.</p>
<p class='c032'>2. The fiery spirits of Muspelheim.</p>
<p class='c032'>3. The Aser, and Asyniar, gods and goddesses.</p>
<p class='c032'>4. The Vanir, or inhabitants of the windy Vanheim.</p>
<p class='c032'>5. Mankind.</p>
<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>6. The Giants and Giantesses; the descendants of Bergelmer
and his wife.</p>
<p class='c032'>7. The Black Elves, or Dwarfs, male and female.</p>
<p class='c032'>8. The subjects of Hela.</p>
<p class='c032'>9. The nondescripts, that it would puzzle the best antiquaries
to say what they are.</p>

<p class='c024'>With most of these we have little acquaintance. A
few of the Light Elves are to be found in the palaces of
the Asyniar; but none of Muspel’s sons do we encounter.
Of the Vanir in general, we know little; but half
a dozen of the race are venerated or esteemed in Asgard.
Utgard and its sons were well known, from their intercourse,
whether hostile, or friendly, with the Aser; and
still better known is Asgard. The land of the Black
Elves was frequently visited by men and gods. The
realms of Hela were but once visited by living feet,—by
those of Hermod.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c023'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Of men we can mention such
only as came into contact with beings of a higher or
lower nature. Most of these classes, therefore, may be
dismissed with a few general observations. Details
respecting <i>individuals</i>, in most of these classes, will be
found under the names of the chief Aser, or gods.</p>

<p class='c024'>Whether the Aser were gods, or mortals only, or men
who had been deified, has been long and zealously disputed.
Each party gives elaborate reasons for its own
hypothesis, and they have been convincing to itself if
not to others. On a subject which requires the aid of
the imagination to understand it, and to which speculation
only can be applied, this diversity was inevitable.
Within the last twenty years, however, a more careful
examination of the pagan monuments of antiquity, and
a more extended acquaintance with the religious systems
of other people, have led to the conclusion that the Aser,
like the Vaner, never existed on earth, and that they are
purely mythologic. There is certainly much reason for
the conclusion. The satisfactory way in which functions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>of the deities have been resolved into physical
qualities may well fortify it. Still there are difficulties—we
think insuperable ones—to be removed. The
account which, in the former volume of this work<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c023'><sup>[40]</sup></a>, we
have given of Odin, Niord, Freyr, and Baldur, will scarcely
countenance the hypothesis. The circumstances which
attended Odin’s progress; those which accompanied and
followed his arrival in the north; his temporal even
more than his spiritual policy; his extraordinary success;
the thrones which he established; the sons whom
he left; the universal anxiety of the northern princes—even
those of Saxony—to claim him as their ancestor,
and an ancestor too only a few generations removed
from them<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c023'><sup>[41]</sup></a>; afford, we think, evidence enough of his
mortal career. Nor should we overlook the fact that
both Saxo Grammaticus and Snorro Sturleson,—the
former well acquainted with the tradition and history
of his country; the latter most deeply versed in the religion
and literature of the Scythian conquerors—contended
for the mortal character of the Aser. In their
days, this was not a new interpretation of the subject:
ascend the stream of time as far as we can, and still we
find that Odin and his pontiff-chiefs were regarded as
men whom credulity had deified. Such was the opinion
of Adam of Bremen in the eleventh century; of the
biographer of St. Anscar in the ninth; of St. Kentigern
in the sixth. In one of his sermons to the pagans
of south-eastern Scotland, the last-named saint upbraided
them with their folly for worshipping one (Odin
or Woden) whom they themselves acknowledged to
have lived on earth,—to have been a Saxon king,—to
have paid the common debt of nature,—one whose
bones had long before been confounded with the dust.
Men of learning, who lived so much nearer to the times
when the pontiff-king reigned in the north—who, for any
thing we know to the contrary, had better evidence than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>tradition for his actions, young as that tradition was, have
thought the same. It has been said, that even the least of
those actions were of too superhuman a character ever to
have been attributed to a mortal; and that the being
concerning whom they were invented, must have been
mythologic. But the assertion would not have been
made, had the memory been consulted: <i>it</i> would have
furnished personages, indisputably historic, concerning
whom wilder legends (if legends can be wilder) have
been invented than concerning the Asiatic conqueror.
What have the ancient Romans or the modern Persians
to say of their kings? What has been said of Attila?
What of Arthur? What of Macbeth and of Don Sebastian?
There are indeed few eminent characters in
the history of the middle ages concerning whom supernatural
tales have not been invented and believed. Perhaps,
however, the term <i>invented</i> may be too severe a
one; for in general the actions or qualities of personages
much more ancient have been transferred to those of
recent date.</p>

<p class='c024'>These difficulties have appeared so formidable to most
of the advocates for the mythological system, that they
have been induced to admit the hypothesis of <i>two</i> Odins,
who appeared in the north at different intervals;—the
former a pontiff, whom superstition afterwards deified;
the other a king, yet the chief of religion, who, seeing
the veneration in which his predecessor was held,
boldly declared himself an incarnation of the same being.
This hypothesis, which is purely arbitrary, so far from
diminishing the difficulty, greatly increases it, and is
not, in other respects, worth another moment’s consideration.
A second is more plausible, and not so arbitrary.
It represents the pontiff-warrior—the <i>second</i> Odin—as
assuming the name, and laying claim to the attributes,
of another Odin, long received as a god. In this case, the
god must have been incarnate in the person of this Scythian
warrior; yet we have not even the shadow of a
proof that metempsychosis was a doctrine ever received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>by the Scandinavians, or by any nation of the Goths. The
Celts had it<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c023'><sup>[42]</sup></a>; yet this wide distinction between the two
races has not prevented them from being confounded.
As well confound the Caffre with the Cherokee. The
Eddas assure us that, when a mortal paid the debt of
nature, or fell in battle, he went at once to Helheim or
Valhalla. Still there are two or three instances in which
a transmigration into other bodies was effected; and
though they are manifestly at variance with the religious
creed of the north, and must be regarded merely as extraordinary
exceptions, we are not disposed to reject
the hypothesis that Odin assumed, or rather, after death,
his people conferred upon him, the name of the god
whom they had so long worshipped. It receives no
little confirmation from the facts stated by Snorro, that
in Asia the pontiff-king was known by the name of
<i>Sigoe</i>. The truth is, that transmigration being an article
of the Celtic creed, Odin might so far avail himself of
it as to pass for the incarnate god. In either case,
however, unless we reject Snorro and Saxo, and the
Saxon Chronicle, and Adam of Bremen, and a host of
writers in the middle ages, we adopt the conclusion
that Odin lived, and reigned, and conquered, in the
north.</p>

<p class='c024'>Advocating then, as we deliberately do, the historical
interpretation, we have yet to account for the extraordinary
powers attributed to mere mortals; for the
extraordinary difference of their religion; for the still
more extraordinary doctrines of that religion, as contained
in the Eddas. The subject is not without its
difficulties; but probably they may be removed by a
few natural reflections. That Odin and his twelve
pontiff-chiefs found, on their arrival in the north, some
kind of religious worship established, nobody will deny.
What were the doctrines of that religion? Here conjecture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>only can guide us: we have no written, no traditionary,
monuments of that antecedent worship. We
read only that the Aser—the Scythian bands from
Asia—had to contend with the native authorities; but
that having in so great a degree the superiority of wisdom,
they compelled the natives to receive their spiritual,
no less than their temporal, yoke. Their arms, no
doubt, effected more than their arguments; but to
suppose that they could extirpate the dominant faith—if
indeed there were not several established modes of
worship in different provinces of the north—would be
very irrational in itself, and irreconcilable with all the
known facts of history. Pagan conquerors have always
been disposed to respect the gods of other people. Every
region was believed to have its own peculiar deities;
and to honour <i>them</i> was necessary, if that region were
to be either permanently or prosperously held. On the
other hand, the natives themselves would, in a superstitious
age, be sufficiently disposed to respect the gods
of their victors; for human prosperity was always regarded
as the work of heaven. If they still retained
their own, they would not refuse homage to the more
powerful stranger gods whose shrines were now transported
among them, and whom they must, by degrees,
consider as their own tutelary divinities. Hence the
union of the two religions; not indeed wholly, but certainly
in a very considerable degree. Their gods would
be joined; so would such dogmas as were not absolutely
irreconcilable with one another; and in a few, a very
few, generations, both would be received by priest and
people as if they had always been identical and indissoluble.
That this <i>has</i> been the case in other countries,
we know from authentic history. It was so with the
Greeks; it was so with the Romans; it has been so
since their conquests with several Asiatic nations. And
reason tells us that this must always be the natural progress
of events.</p>

<p class='c024'>But on this subject we have more than conjecture,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>or even reason; we have facts. There are in the Eddas,
and still more in the Scaldic interpretations, principles
too repugnant to each other ever completely to harmonise.
We know that Thor was more esteemed in Norway
than Odin; and that in Denmark, no less than in
Sweden, Odin was more highly venerated than Thor.
The reason is, that the Goths, or, we should rather say,
the last swarm of them that arrived with Odin, had
more influence in these latter kingdoms than in the
former. Thor, indeed, was almost exclusively worshipped
by the Norwegians, who invoked Odin only on
the eve of a battle. They held the former to be immeasurably
the superior of the other; and, in contradiction
to the Swedes and Danes, contended that Odin
was the son of Thor. The elder Edda calls him the
most powerful of the gods; and in the Sagas, by the
most ancient Scalds, he is represented as frequently hostile
to the other deity. Considering these facts, and the
universal homage still paid to Thor by the Finns and
Lapps—people of the same race with the Norwegians—we
are of opinion that Thor was the native, Odin the
foreign, divinity. The giants, too, appear to have been
of native, perhaps of Celtic, origin, and to have been
adopted by the Scythian Goths, after their arrival;
while the <i>black</i> dwarfs, whose habitation was in the
bowels of the earth, were introduced by the latter, and
soon made a portion of the native creed. The white,
or benevolent elves, were universally received by the
Goths; but the dark, the malignant elves, seem to have
been brought from an eastern region. It is in the
highest degree absurd to suppose that if there had been
no foreign admixture with that creed, and a very large
admixture, we should have nine different worlds, with
their complicated, often dissonant relation to one another.
Where this complexity, and, still more, this evident
dissonance between the elements, are found to exist, we
may safely conclude that they have been introduced at
different periods; that the mighty and irregular edifice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>has been reared by different hands. But if there were
no other argument to establish the dissonance for
which we contend, and the forcible union of opinions
never intended to harmonise, it would be sufficiently obvious
from the distinction between the two great systems
of creation to which we have already alluded—the
Ymerian or animal, and Yggdrasil or vegetable.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c023'><sup>[43]</sup></a> Beyond
all doubt, they were as distinct in their origin as
in their nature; and were long held by the people essentially
different. We are strongly disposed to regard the
Ymerian as the native, the Yggdrasil as the foreign,
system. Giants were more kindred with the Celtic than
with the Gothic creed. By the latter, indeed, they were
hated even more than feared. Whoever will peruse
with attention those passages of the two Eddas where
giants are mentioned, will probably arrive at the same
conclusion with ourselves—that they were foreign to
the genius of the Scythians. We may adore what we
<i>fear</i>; but we never adore what we <i>hate</i>, still less what
we <i>despise</i>. The same may be observed in regard to
the magical rites of the two people. Of <i>dark</i> magic
we read every where amongst the people of the former
race. We meet with it in districts where the Scythian
Goth never inhabited—in the more remote districts of
Lapland and Finland. The rites, the opinions, of the
people in these districts, were also, we believe, the rites,
the opinions, of all the people that inhabited Norway
and Sweden. Some of them, we know, were disliked by
the followers of Odin. It was not Odinian, that is
Gothic, or <i>white</i> (innocent) magic, that was professed
by Raude of Norway.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c023'><sup>[44]</sup></a> It was not Odinian, or Gothic,
magic that caused Harald Harfager to be captivated so
long and so fatally by the daughter of the Finnish
Swaso.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c023'><sup>[45]</sup></a> In the latter case, nothing can be more evident
than that it was the native, black magic, which
produced this effect. Hence the detestation with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>that monarch, pagan as he was, regarded the art.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c023'><sup>[46]</sup></a> It
was not Odin’s magic which Egill practised when he left
Norway, outlawed by Eric of the Bloody Axe. Before
he finally left the coast, he fixed the head of a horse on
one of the oars of the vessel, and raising it aloft, exclaimed,
“Here I erect the rod of vengeance against
king Eric and queen Gunhilda!” Turning the horse’s
head in another direction, he exclaimed “I direct this
curse also against the tutelary deities of Norway, that
they shall wander, in pain, and have no rest for the
soles of their feet, until they have expelled the king and
queen!” This strange imprecation he then carved in
runic characters upon the oar, and placed it in the cleft of
a rock, where it was not likely to be found, or the spell
to be dissolved. It was native magic that distinguished
Gunhilda, wife of Eric with the Bloody Axe.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c023'><sup>[47]</sup></a> More
than one king who worshiped Odin punished with death
the observers of these rites. And in most of the Gothic
writers, pagan or christian, the palm of superiority in
magic is awarded to native professors. The magic of
the latter might be darker, more inhuman, more diabolical,
but it was also admitted to be more profound
and more potent. We agree with Magnussen in the
conclusion that there was a union, more or less complete,
of two schools of magic, as well as of two religions.
But there were tenets which could <i>not</i> be reconciled, and
the natives, by adhering to their own, caused a system
to be perpetuated essentially at variance with that of the
conquerors.</p>

<p class='c024'>These facts, these arguments, will be admitted to have
considerable weight. We shall adduce another which,
joined with the preceding, should set the subject as to
the fact of a religion having been dominant in the north
anterior to the Odinic, and essentially different from it.
Rude stones and rocks—so rude as scarcely to have a
form—were lately, and probably are now, worshipped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>by the more remote Finns and Lapps. This idol they
term the <i>Storjunkar</i>, or great ruler; they offer sacrifices
upon it (generally the rein-deer), and prostrate before it,
in certain mountainous districts, far from the usual habitations
of men.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c023'><sup>[48]</sup></a> This worship is a relic of the idolatry
once common to the Norwegians, no less than to the
Finns and Laps, who are of the same origin. That it
was celebrated in Norway is certain; for we find it in
Iceland as late as the close of the tenth century. Indrid
was the mortal enemy of Thorstein; and one night
he left his house to murder him. The latter entered a
temple where he was accustomed to worship, prostrated
himself before a stone, and prayed to know his fate.
The stone replied, in a kind of chant, that his feet were
already in the grave; that his fatal enemy was at hand,
and that he would never see the rising of the next morning’s
sun. All such stones, all such gods, were foreign
to the Scythian Goths; and this relation, connected with
others which might be easily extracted, proves that the
Norwegians, who had felt little of the Asiatic yoke, had
retained many of their gods, many of their religious
rites, in defiance of opposition.</p>

<p class='c024'>To say more on this subject in the present place
would be useless; as in the course of the present chapter
we shall have opportunities enough both of adverting to
the more ancient superstition, and of comparing the
two. It will, we believe, be found that much of the
Eddaic cosmogony is of native growth; that the majority
of the worlds and of their inhabitants were native;
and that the Scythian warriors added little more than
their Midgard, their Asgard, especially their Valhalla;
their twelve gods (except Thor), with Odin at their
head; their female deities (scarcely a dozen in number);
and such other points of the creed as were necessary to
connect and illustrate their cardinal articles.</p>

<p class='c024'>The question of two distinct religions being conceded,
it will not be difficult to account for the progress which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Odin and his companions made towards deification.
Most of the steps, indeed, have been indicated on a former
occasion<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c023'><sup>[49]</sup></a>, and need not be repeated here. Few were the
regal pontiffs of Asia who did not boast of their descent
from some god—some warrior king, whom after ages,
admiring his success, had deified. Odin was not likely
to neglect so useful an instrument for his designs. Then
as he and the Vanir chiefs were unquestionably a much
more civilised people than the natives of the north; as
his talents, beyond all doubt, were of a commanding
order; as the religious rites of which he was the superior
hereditary pontiff, were celebrated with more pomp;
as success attended all his measures, whether of war or
of policy; as he himself, and his followers for him,
laid claim to something of a divine character, the natives
soon regarded him as a supernatural personage. The
feeling was no doubt shared by his own people, who
had always been taught to believe that a divine spirit
might inhabit the bosom of a hero or a king. As in
former ages Rovstam and Jemsheed, so in later ages
Alaric and Attila, were beheld with equal reverence.
With equal reverence at this day do the Chinese, the
Thibetians, the Tartars, regard <i>their</i> rulers. So did the
Mexicans and the Peruvians. From Snorro, however,
we learn that the progress of Odin towards deification
was much slower than is generally supposed. He expressly
intimates that the king began to be peculiarly
honoured <i>after</i> his death: “From this time men began
to have more faith in Odin, and to offer him vows.”
If his pretensions to divinity were recognised, so must
those of his chief pontiffs; since the cause and the interests
of the two were inseparable.</p>

<p class='c024'>The original seat of that colony of the Goths which
Odin led into the north, has, with much appearance of
reason, been placed east of the Tanais or Don: probably
it was considerably to the east of that river. On
this subject we can have no better guide than Snorro:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“The orb of the world, in which dwell the race of
mankind, is, as we are informed, intersected with bays
and gulfs: great seas from the ocean penetrate the
firm land. It is well known that from the Straits
of Gibraltar (Njövasund) a great sea extends quite
to Palestine (Jórsala-land). From this sea there
lies towards the north-east, a gulf called the Black
Sea, which separates the three parts of the world
from each other: the land to the east is called Europe,
by others Enea. Northerly from the Black Sea
lies the greater or cold <i>Svithjód</i> (Svecia or Scythia
magna). Some affirm that great Svithjód is not of less
extent than Serkland (North Africa): others even compare
it with the great Blá-land Æthiopia magna).
The northern part of Svithjód is uncultivated on account
of the frost and cold, in the same manner as
the southern part of Bláland lies waste, on account
of the burning heat. In great Svithjód are many
provinces peopled with various tribes of different tongues.
There are giants and dwarfs; there are black men,
and dragons and other wild beasts of prodigious size.
Towards the north, in the mountains beyond the habitable
country, rises a river properly called the Tanais,
but which has obtained the name of the Tanasquisl, or
Vanasquil, and which running through Svithjód, falls
into the Black Sea. The country encircled by the
branches of this river was in those days called Vanaland
or Vanaheimr. This stream separates the <i>three</i>
parts of the world from each other, the part lying east
being called Asia, and that to the west Europe. The
country to the east of Tanasquisl in Asia was called
Asaland or Asaheimr, and the capital of that country,
Asgard. There ruled Odin, and there too was a great
place of sacrifice. Twelve pontiffs (hofgodar) presided
in the temples, who were at the same time the judges
of the law.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c023'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>Defective as was the geographical knowledge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Snorro, he has, no doubt, correctly assigned the cradle
of this people, and of the Vanir. They were neighbours;
they were consequently often at war, until the
chiefs of both agreed, not only to be for ever amicable,
and to join in all future conquests, but in some degree
to amalgamate by a union of government. Hence the
junction of the Vanir to the Aser, and the contiguity
of their respective regions in the Scandinavian calendar.
How Asgard and Vanaheim came to be placed in
heaven, as well as on earth, has puzzled many writers.
They may be equally puzzled, that the twelve drothmen,
or pontiff-chiefs, should be transfused into so many
divinities; and the temple of the earthly transferred to
the celestial Asgard. There are two ways of solving
this problem. It is possible—it is even exceedingly
probable—that the Scythians, long prior to their migration
from Asia, called their country after the heavenly
one which they expected to inhabit after death.
The government of the Aser was essentially theocratic,
and assimilated as much as possible to that which they
believed to exist above. Nor were they peculiar in this
economy: Athens and greater nations have done the same.
The twelve great priests of Egypt were named after the
twelve gods who ruled the same number of celestial
signs. Such was the case in Assyria. In Persia, too,
the number of priests in the great temple corresponded
with that of the Amshaspands, or celestial genii, who
governed the world as vicegerents of Ormusd. Nothing,
indeed, is more natural than the position, that men devoted
to the service of the gods would endeavour to
form their establishments after the model which the
gods themselves were believed to have adopted. “Thus,
the Aser were the gods of the new religion introduced by
Odin, and at the same time his temporal companions
and followers,—the tribe of the Ases, or Aso-Goths,
from the river Tanais. Asgard, or Godheim, is their
celestial abode, from which they descended on earth
(Manheim) to mingle with the children of men; and is,
at the same time, the original seat of Odin and his people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>on the river Tanais.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c023'><sup>[51]</sup></a> This we consider the more
natural solution of the problem in question. It may,
however, be, that the disciples of the original pontiff
began after his death to invest both him and his companions
with the ensigns of divinity, and assimilated
them, both in number and in attributes, with the
ancient divinities of Scythia; making, however, some
change. In either case there must have been a change.
We have before expressed our opinion that Thor was
not a Scythian god: he, therefore, (and the same may be
said of one or two others,) must have been subsequently
admitted into the divine college, when the union for
which we have contended took place between the native
and foreign religion; or rather, when the foreign was
engrafted on the native system. That system, we
repeat, was, in our opinion, the basis of the one contained
in the Eddas; and much more than the basis.</p>

<p class='c024'>The union which we have endeavoured to establish,
will account for the elaborate, however heterogeneous,
system of the Eddas. That system was, assuredly, not
the work of one people, or, we may add, of one age.
It was derived from people widely different in character,
habits, opinions, and manners; and it was probably
the work of centuries. The successors of the twelve
original pontiffs effected, there is reason to think, much
more than <i>they</i> did, or than their predecessors had done.
The elements were, indeed, strewed in Norway; but
they could scarcely be fashioned into a whole; still less
could they have assumed that stately form which they
exhibited in the age of Sæmund and Snorro. They consisted
of detached portions, composed at different periods,
and probably not connected—not fashioned into a
whole—until many centuries after Odin’s death. Nay,
there is some reason for concluding, that the two
Icelanders we have just mentioned were the first collectors
of these scattered fragments, no less than of the
comments on each by the recent Scalds of their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>country, and the more ancient Scalds of Norway. Of
the same opinion the reader will probably be, before he
closes the present volume.</p>

<p class='c024'>Having now given a general view both of the Scandinavian
universe and of its inhabitants, and shown the
probable relation between its gods and its mortals, we
proceed, in the following section, to examine these gods
more in detail, and, where practicable, to explain their
respective attributes by the physical phenomena on which
they were so frequently based.</p>

<p class='c024'>The first two gods we place together, as well for the
purpose of comparison as that of contrast; the last,
because his agency is necessary to explain the other two.</p>

<p class='c024'>According to the Eddas, <span class='sc'>Odin</span> had several wives; the
first was <i>Frea</i>, or <i>Frigga</i>, by whom he had five sons,
Thor, Balder, Braga, Hermod, and Tyr: the second
was <i>Skada</i>, by whom he had Semming; the third was
<i>Grydur</i>, by whom he had Vidar; the fourth was <i>Rinda</i>,
by whom he had Balder, or Bo.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c023'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>In Valhalla he has a table separate from the Einheriar,
but he lives only on wine; and the meats set before
him he distributes to two wolves which stand by his side.
These are <i>Geri</i> the devouring, and <i>Freki</i> the fierce.</p>

<p class='c024'>He learns all that passes on earth, without the trouble
of ascending Lidskialf<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c023'><sup>[53]</sup></a>, by means of two ravens, which
leave Asgard at daybreak, and at dinner time return, to
perch on his shoulders, and whisper into his ear all that
they have seen. These ravens are—Observation and
Memory; both presents from the enchantress Hulda.
Hence he is called the raven god.</p>

<p class='c024'>These mythi are for the most part sufficiently obvious.
Frigga is a personification of the earth; while
Odin himself, in his character of chief god, may represent
heaven. Heaven and earth give origin to—thunder
(Thor), the summer-sun (Balder), the swift messenger
(Hermod), the hospitable board (Braga), and the undaunted
defender of nature (Tyr). Skada, the daughter
of the giant Thiasse, and a nymph of the mountains,
is a personification of the spring winds; but we cannot
see the import of the mythos—if, indeed, there were
any intended—in regard to Semming. Why Vidar should
be the offspring of Grydur is equally dark; but there is
propriety enough in making the frost (Rinda) the mother
of barrenness. The two wolves at Odin’s side denote
his ferocity as the god of battles; and the two ravens,
memory and observation, explain his knowledge of the
past and present. To that of the future this god had
no pretensions; this was reserved to the Norny Skulda,
and to a few of the Valas, or prophetesses.</p>

<p class='c024'>Immediately dependent on Odin—the ministers of
his will as the god of war—were the three Valkyrs, or
choosers of the slain. They also administer to the slain
at his banquet.</p>

<p class='c024'>There are many legends respecting Odin, who often
visited mankind. We select one because it illustrates
the observations we have made in regard to the rivalry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>of him and Thor. Sterkodder, the celebrated champion<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c023'><sup>[54]</sup></a>,
when a child, was taken captive. He fell to the lot of
one named Granè, or Whiskers, who was named Horsehair
Whiskers, and who brought him up as a foster-son.
This was no other than Odin in disguise, whose
attachment to one destined to become so unrivalled in
arms may be easily conceived. One night the destiny
of the young man, unknown to himself, was to be
shown him. Horsehair Whiskers, of whose quality
he was ignorant, embarked with him in a small boat,
and they proceeded to an island, landed, and by midnight
reached an open plain in the centre of a forest.
There he saw a large assemblage; and within the
ring formed by the assemblage were twelve seats, for so
many judges. Eleven were full, but one was empty,
and Horsehair Whiskers immediately seated himself in
it. From the instantaneous salute of Odin by the
judges, and the mention of his name, the chieftain
perceived that he was in the awful presence of that deity,
and of the other gods. Odin said that the judges should
now decree Sterkodder his destiny. Thor then spoke and
said, “Alfhild, the mother of Sterkodder’s father, chose
for her son’s-father (<i>husband</i>) a very wise Jötunn (<i>giant</i>)
in preference to Asathor; wherefore I appoint to Sterkodder
that he shall have neither son nor daughter, and
thus be the last of his race.”</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Odin.</i> “I grant him to live three men’s age.”</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Thor.</i> “He shall do a vile act in each of them.”</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Odin.</i> “I give him that he shall own the best weapons
and harness.”</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Thor.</i> “And I appoint him that he shall own
neither land nor sand.”</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Odin.</i> “I give him that he shall be rich in money.”</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Thor.</i> “I lay on him that he shall never seem to
have enough.”</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Odin.</i> “I give him victory and martial skill in every
fight.”</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span><i>Thor.</i> “I lay on him that in every fight he shall lose
a limb.”</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Odin.</i> “I give him the poet’s faculty, so that he
shall produce poems with as much ease as unmeasured
language.”</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Thor.</i> “He shall never be able to remember the
verses he makes.”</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Odin.</i> “I grant him that he shall be favoured by
those of greatest rank and name.”</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Thor</i>. “He shall be hated by all others.”</p>

<p class='c024'>Then the judges ratified to Sterkodder all that had
been said, and the council broke up.</p>

<p class='c024'>The Saga from which this incident has been derived
was written by a Norwegian, who certainly held Thor
to be the equal, if not the superior, of Odin. It is not
unlike the magian scene at the creation of the world,
when to every good thing decreed by Ormusd, an evil
one was joined by Ahriman. That Odin and Thor
were rival deities, and that they gave rise to hostile
sects, is evident. And there is another point from which
this hostility may be viewed. The warriors who went
to Valhalla were all of noble birth; they were jarls or
herser, were rich and powerful. But what became
of meaner freemen and thralls (serfs) who fell in battle?
They went to Thrudheim to the palace of Thor, Bilskirner<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c023'><sup>[55]</sup></a>,
which that the owner might not be outdone,
had the same number of gates as the palace of Odin, viz.
five hundred and forty. Does not this prove that Thor
was the native, Odin the foreign, god?—that the former
belonged to the vanquished, the latter to the victorious
people? The very name of Thor shows that he was a
Celtic divinity. He is the <i>Taranis</i> of Lucan, the Toron
of the Scottish Highlands, and the Tiermes of the
Lapps.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c023'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>The visit of Odin to the giant Vafthrudnir, and his
contest with him<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c023'><sup>[57]</sup></a>, may also serve to illustrate his boasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>knowledge, as well as power. Frigga, his wife, was
alarmed when she first heard of her husband’s intention
to visit “that learned giant.” He conquers, indeed, in
the strife, but not through any superiority of knowledge:
it is rather by an unworthy artifice.</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Frigga</i>, the wife of Odin, was a distinguished personage
in the northern Olympus. She is the queen
and mother of the gods. Her palace, called Fensale, was
magnificent; and it was a sort of drawing-room for all the
goddesses. Her prescience was great; she could foresee
the future, and she was invoked by women in childbed.</p>

<p class='c024'>According to the vulgar genealogy,—that which the
Odinists, in opposition to the Thorists, were anxious to
establish,—<span class='sc'>Thor</span> was the eldest son of Odin and
Frigga. Even in Sweden he was, after Odin, the first
in rank among the gods. We may even doubt whether
by one sect of the Odinists he was not esteemed the first;
for his image at Upsal, where he is represented seated
on a throne, with the attributes of divine majesty about
him,—while Odin, the war god, is standing at his right
hand with a drawn sword, and Frigga, the goddess of
production, on his left, with the fruits of nature in
her hands,—clearly establishes his predominancy. His
strength was unrivalled; and his structure so large, that
no horse could carry him: he always travelled in a
chariot drawn by two he-goats. He had three treasures,
all unrivalled, all made by the Dwarfs. Of these the
most famous was his hammer, called <i>Miölner</i> (the miller,
the bruiser), which, when thrown by his powerful
hand, was irresistible; yet, however far it was thrown,
it always returned to him. Formidable as it was, it
was so small that he could put it in his pocket. No
hands but his could touch it; nor even he without his
wonderful steel gloves, the second of his treasures.
The third was a belt,—<i>Melgingandur</i>, which doubled
his strength whenever he girded it on. Above all the
gods, he was the enemy of the Rimthurser, or Frost
Giants, against whom, with his dreaded weapon, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>waged unceasing war. The very glare of his eyes was
tremendous: it was lightning; and lightning was emitted
by his chariot wheels as he rolled along. Every day
did he make the circuit of Asgard, to drive away the
giants.</p>

<p class='c024'>Of this mythos an interpretation is scarcely necessary.
Miölner is his thunderbolt. His antipathy to the
giants—the powers alike of darkness and of cold, and
his daily circuit round Asgard, sufficiently explain
themselves. His gloves and belt were an embellishment,
which have no necessary connection with his nature.
The latter is to be found in many oriental fictions, (the
Arabian Nights, for instance,) and in many also current
throughout Europe. His wife, <i>Sif</i>, is another illustration
of the mythos. She is held to be a personification
of the summer earth, and is represented in the
act of distributing fruits and flowers. She, like her
husband, was peculiarly worshipped in Norway. By a
former husband she had a son—Uller, the god of
hunters, whose residence was Ydale, or the Dewy
Valley.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c023'><sup>[58]</sup></a> The most wonderful of her peculiarities was
her <i>hair</i>, which was unrivalled for its beauty, and to
which we have before adverted.</p>

<p class='c024'>The fact, that Sif was worshipped in Norway alone,
of all the Scandinavian regions, is another argument in
favour of her husband’s supreme worship, long before
the arrival of the Aser. A still stronger one is to be
found in the fact, that Thrudheim, or Thrudvang, was
the name of a district in that kingdom, no less than
of a palace in heaven: and the strongest of all is, the
peculiar affection with which he was regarded by the
Norwegians, who held him to be their native, their
tutelary god. He seems to have had some attributes
of the Roman thunderer: the same day (Thursday),
and the same planet (Jupiter), were sacred to him.</p>

<p class='c024'>The giants of whom Thor was thus the natural, the
everlasting enemy, were, as we have frequently observed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the offspring of Bergelmer, the old man of the
mountains, and of his wife, who escaped the destruction
of their race by the blood of Ymer, only because they
chanced to be at sea, fishing, when the giant was slain.
Repairing to the dark lower region which lies within
the polar seas, they soon peopled it. Darkness, indeed,
was the element of these beings: no sun enlightened
or cheered them. When they visited earth, it was
during the night, for then their power was the greatest.
In magic they surpassed all other beings: they possessed
many secrets, relating to the origin and nature of
things, unknown to the wisest of the gods. With them
the three Nornies, or destinies,—with them Vala herself,
the great prophetess of heaven, was educated. They
regarded the Aser with dislike,—as usurpers of a world
which rightly belonged to them; and towards the sons
of Askur, the creation of the gods, they bore equal
dislike. This feeling, indeed, did not prevent the Aser
from occasionally intermarrying with them; but the
marriages were never well assorted. The king of this
vast gloomy region was Ugarthiloc, or, more correctly,
Utgardelok, viz. the Loke of Utgard, the monarch of the
outer world. The notion entertained of this personage,
and of the whole race, by the Danes, we have shown on
a former occasion.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c023'><sup>[59]</sup></a> Wild as the legends there related
may seem, they have their meaning. The reader will
not fail to observe, that these original inhabitants of the
earth—this people destroyed by the Aser, and exiled
into the dreary wastes of the North, were the original
Finnish, or rather Celtic race, whom the Goths expelled.
The mythology of that race was full of giants; the
Druids boasted of an acquaintance with nature denied to
the rest of mankind; and the boast was probably a just
one. The testimony borne by Cæsar to the extensive
character of their knowledge, will abundantly illustrate
this part of the historical question. Again, the Celts
pretended to mystical science: in proof of it, look to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Cæsar, to the traditions rife wherever the Celts have
been located, and, above all, to the fragments of the
ancient Welsh bards preserved in the Archæologia of
the principality. The Eddas are filled with Celtic
mythological allusions. For example, Celtic were the
dwarfs or fairies of the benevolent class; while the
malignant ones, who were a kind of evil genii, came
with the Aser from a seat where the two principles of
good and evil were a dominant article of the popular
creed.</p>

<p class='c024'>A personage no less important than Odin or Thor in
the Scandinavian mythology, is <span class='sc'>Loke</span>, or, as he is sometimes
called, Luptur. He was important, not from his
power, or his wisdom, or his dignity, but from his
cunning, his treachery, his ill-nature, and the influence
which he exercised alike over gods and men. He was
the son of the giant Farbautè, by the enchantress
Laufeya. Though of giant race, he obtained admission
among the gods: indeed, as his manners were exceedingly
pleasant, his mirth constant, and his wit unbounded,
whenever they were not mixed with spite, he
could not fail to be acceptable to so vulgar a race as the
Aser. But when, as indeed was often the case, there
was malice in his jokes, his laughter made the hearer
shudder. Why the gods should tolerate him, is not
very clear; but destiny was probably the reason which a
devout Odinist would have assigned for it,—a very
convenient reason in most systems of mythology. His
birth might be traced to the origin of time; for, in
some way or other, he was concerned with Odin in the
work of creation, though the connection is very obscurely
hinted at. He was a relation, we are told, of
the Utgard Loke, or Ugarthiloc, the monarch of the
frosty giants. These two personages were no doubt
originally the same; but as the Celts and Aser had
different notions of the same being, it was found necessary
to introduce the two into the united creed. In virtue
of his connection with them, Loke often visited the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>giants, by whom he was as little trusted as by the
Aser. But he was sometimes useful to both; and,
from the malice of his nature, no less than from his
dislike to the gods, whom he at once feared and hated,
he was frequently the ally of the giants in their efforts
to recover their lost dominion, and to destroy the
usurpers. If he thus brought the latter into danger,
he alone could extricate them from it. In perfect
accordance with the Eddas, he is thus described by
Ohlenschlager:—</p>

<p class='c021'>He was, indeed, as a god, the familiar companion
of Thor; who, however, had no great wish for his
society. Like most of the gods, he was married. His
wife, <i>Signe</i>, was an amiable being, who loved him in
spite of his depravity. By her he had two sons, Nari
and Vali, whose fate will be mentioned in the proper
place. But he had other and more mischievous offspring
by the giantess Augerbode,—<i>Fenris</i> the wolf,
<i>Jormungandur</i> the great serpent, and <i>Hela</i> the queen
of death. This alleged affinity will confirm the observation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>that there was originally but one Loke, the lord
of Utgard, and consequently the everlasting foe of the
gods. How the Asgard Loke should become so wicked
as to produce such offspring, might surprise us, if we
were not assured that he was not so originally, and that
he became so by eating the half-roasted heart of an
enchantress.</p>

<p class='c024'>These three children of Loke were reared in Utgard
by the mother. The fatal influence which they were
to exercise over the universe, was not concealed from
Vala, the mysterious prophetess of heaven, or from
Skulda, the Norny of the future. The gods being
warned, sent to secure them. Jormungandur, one of
the most dreaded, was seized, and by Odin cast into
the great sea that separates the human from the giant
world. There so large did it become, that it surrounded
the whole earth,—being condemned to hold its tail in
its mouth, and thus to form a circle. There he lies,
waiting for the time when destiny will unloose him—the
Ragnarok, or the twilight of the gods; when he will
assist in the destruction of the visible universe.</p>

<p class='c024'>Hela, the next mythologic offspring, is hideous to
behold,—her body being half livid, half of natural
colour. By Odin, or rather by destiny, of which he
was merely the instrument, she was placed in the
upper confines of Nifleheim,—in the region which,
from her, is called Hell (Helheim). She was invested
with dominion over six, or perhaps seven, of the nine
worlds, (as we have before observed, there is some doubt
whether Muspelheim be eternal,)—over men, and dwarfs,
and giants, and gods. All who die a natural death
proceed to her “drear abode:” hence her title, queen
of the dead. “Hela’s hall,” says the prose Edda, “is
affliction; her table is famine; her knife is hunger;
her threshold, a drawbridge; her bed, lingering sickness;
her tent, cursing.” She too, like Odin, had nornies,
whose province it was to summon mortals to her vast
domain. But these were much inferior in loveliness
and dignity to the celestial nornies. They appeared to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the fated victim by night only. Hela herself was
sometimes believed thus to appear. She had a dark
red cock, to signify, by its crowing, the approach of fate;
and a spectre horse, to carry the doomed to her gloomy
abode.</p>

<p class='c024'>The third demon offspring of Loke, the wolf
Fenris, is no less wonderful than his brother and sister.
The one had been surprised and, thrown into the sea;
the other had been partly persuaded to submit, through
the high dignity offered to her; but Fenris, who was
more powerful, was also more troublesome. He was
taken, indeed, and bound; but he snapped his fetters,
strong as they were, as if they had been nothing. A
massive chain was now made, and he was bid to try
its strength: it snapped as if it had been dried clay.
Another was made double the strength of the preceding,—the
strongest that the gods could make; but with a
very slight effort it too gave way. What was to be done
with this formidable criminal,—one destined, if oracles
were true, to endanger the world? The gods had no
fetter in which to bind him; the giants, who were
skilful, could not be expected to join in any design
against one of their own body,—one, too, that was
naturally hostile to the Aser. In this, as in many other
dilemmas, recourse was had to the Dwarfs in the
bowels of the earth. At the instance of Skirnir, the
messenger of Freyr, they constructed a chain called
Gleipner; which, though so slender as to resemble a
silken thread, was nevertheless not to be broken by gods,
or giants, or dwarfs. The Edda acquaints us with
the materials of which it was constructed. These were
six, all curious enough to deserve mentioning:—the
sound made by the feet of a cat; the beard of a woman;
the roots of huge rocks; the fibres of trees; the breath
of fishes; the spittle of birds. But how bind by it the
formidable monster? Deceit must be used. Repairing
with him to a solitary island, the gods desired him to try
his strength on this, as he had done on preceding things.
“Little honour,” replied the cunning demon, “can result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>from breaking a silken thread; but probably it may
be enchanted!” and he refused to try it. He was next
taunted and jeered; and in vexation he at length consented
to be bound; but then, to be assured that the
gods were honest in their proffer, he insisted that some
one of them should put a hand in his mouth. They
were in utter dismay; but the undaunted Tyr<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c023'><sup>[62]</sup></a>, the
northern Mars, the defender of the gods, at length resolved
to sacrifice a member for the preservation of the
universe. He therefore placed his hand in the open
jaw, and the wolf allowed himself to be fettered. The
chain was cunningly fastened round his body, passed
through a rent rock, carried downwards to the centre of
the earth, and there made fast. Fenris now tried as
before; but so far from escaping, every effort that he
made only entangled him the more, and rivetted his
bonds the more firmly. He therefore desisted; but in
his anger he bit off the hand of Tyr. From that
moment the god has been only left-handed; but as he
uses that hand with much effect, he is still to be
dreaded. He alone had courage to take food to an
animal, the roaring of which was felt by all nature,
until the gods thrust a sword into his jaws, and thus
gagged him. There he lies until Ragnarok, when, like
Midgard’s serpent, he will break loose.</p>

<p class='c024'>There is no personage in the whole system of a more
mythic character than Loke. He was evidently the
personification of the active evil principle. His name
signifies <i>flame</i>; and he is a representative of the demon
of fire—the <i>destructive</i>, in opposition to the alimentary,
aerial fire, of which Balder may be considered the
symbol. At this day the devil is called Loke by the
Norwegians. Still there is frequently some obscurity
in the mythi respecting him, and it is occasioned by
his being so often confounded with the demon king of
Utgard. Though they were originally <i>one</i>, the Edda
has made him into two, in conformity no doubt with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>genius of two distinct systems of mythology. The
mysterious allusion to the assistance which he afforded
Odin in the work of creation, is one great proof of his
identification with the powers of evil: his relationship
with the giants, on both sides, sufficiently accounts for
his hostility towards the gods, with whom he associated
that he might find an opportunity of triumphing
over them. He is styled a coward, because his deeds
will not bear the light—the inventor of deceit, of lies,
of every thing base. The first of his offspring, the
great serpent, is evidently a relic of the Celtic creed. The
Britons acknowledged its existence; and there are two
bold promontories on the coast to which they have given
the name of the Worm’s Head.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c023'><sup>[63]</sup></a> Of the wolf Fenris
the character is more obscure, though no less confirmatory
of the mythos. It is doubtless a symbol of destruction.
In several countries of the East, it is believed
that a wolf will finally destroy, if not the world, the
sun and moon. Thus, in the Budhist system, a wolf,
Rakoo, is always on the watch to swallow both luminaries.
This mythos, we suspect, with a living writer<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c023'><sup>[64]</sup></a>,
has given rise to the superstition so common in the
middle ages,—that of men-wolves; viz., the power
possessed by some men of assuming the form of that
animal. Hela, or death, the offspring of sin, or Satan
(Loke), needs no explanation. We may, however,
observe, that there is some plausibility in the arguments
of Magnussen, when he attempts to show that Helheim
is more ancient than Valhalla; that it is the place of
punishment acknowledged by the original inhabitants,
while the warrior’s heaven was introduced by the Gothic
conquerors.</p>

<p class='c024'>The mythological fables in which Loke so prominently
appears, will illustrate his character better, and
certainly more agreeably, than any formal description.
In most of them he was associated with Thor; but we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>select one in which Odin and Hoenir were concerned
with him. Hoenir, we must observe, is but another
name for Vile, the brother of Odin, who assisted in the
work of creation.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c023'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

    <div>RAPE OF IDUNA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The three Aser one day left Asgard to see other
worlds, especially Utgard. Travelling over dreary wastes,
they reached a mountainous region, more hungry than
they had for some time been. Entering a valley, they
found a herd of cattle, and killed one of the animals
for supper. Loke, who was to be the cook, made a fire,
and proceeded to his task, while the two nobler gods
walked about. But notwithstanding the great heat
of the fire, the ox would not roast. A voice, from the
tree above him, told him that he would have no supper
unless he promised to let the speaker join. He looked
up, and seeing an eagle only, gave his consent. The
bird now descended to the fire, and seized both shoulders,
which he, considering as somewhat too large a share,
would not permit. Taking a large billet of wood, he
struck the unreasonable animal; when the eagle instantly
flew upwards, one end of the billet adhering to its beak.
But alas! the other end was no less tenacious of Loke’s
hand; and away he was dragged over mountain, wood,
and stream, his arm ready to fall from his body, and
his feet sorely wounded by being trailed over the sharp
rocks and bushes. He lustily called for help to Odin
and Thor. “Cry away!” replied the eagle, who was
no other than the giant Thiasse in that shape<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c023'><sup>[66]</sup></a>; “but
never shalt thou be released from this situation, unless
thou promise by oath to bring Iduna and her apples
from Asgard to me!”</p>

<p class='c024'>Iduna was the wife of Braga, the god of eloquence,
and daughter to the dwarf Ivalldr, one of the most
scientific of his race. She was a goddess, and the wife
of a god: for both honours she was no doubt indebted
to the wonderful apples of which she was the guardian,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and which had been given her by her kindred. They
had this virtue, that when the gods felt the approach of
age, they had only to eat of these apples to be restored
to all the bloom of youth. The giants, like the gods,
were subject to decay; and, like the gods, they wished
for the means of immortality,—to escape the dark empire
of Hela.</p>

<p class='c024'>As Loke was no friend to the Aser, he swore to
comply with the giant’s demand, within a given time.
He was therefore released, and enabled to return with
the two gods to Asgard. When the covenanted time
arrived, he told Iduna, that in a neighbouring wood he
had discovered some apples, much finer, and much more
valuable, than any she possessed. Her curiosity being
raised, she took some of her own apples with her, to
compare with the others, and was accompanied by
Loke to the wood; but scarcely had they passed the
boundary of Asgard, than Thiasse arriving in the
eagle’s shape, bore her away to the dark mountains of
Utgard.</p>

<p class='c024'>Great was the consternation of the Aser at the disappearance
of Iduna and her apples. The effect was soon
visible: they became weaker, less supple, decrepit, and
wrinkled. Though the season was spring, the flowers
withered, and the leaves became sear as at the close of
autumn. A council of the gods was convoked to learn
how and whither Iduna had disappeared. No one
could give them any other information than this,—that
she had been last seen with Loke departing from Asgard.
Loke was examined; and when he showed a disposition
to evade the questions that were asked, Thor seized him,
and threw him into the air so high that his heels struck
the moon, and then descended to the sea. All this was
nothing in comparison with what he would suffer if he
did not restore the goddess. He readily promised to
do so, if Freya would lend him her disguise, that of a
hawk. Being furnished with it, he flew in that disguise
to Utgard, and reached the abode of Thiasse just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>as that giant had left it to row for a short time on the
neighbouring sea. Changing Iduna into a swallow, he
returned with her in his claws towards Asgard. When
Thiasse returned, and learned the departure of the goddess,
he resumed his eagle’s dress, and rapidly followed
in the direction which the hawk had taken. He obtained
sight of the fugitives just as they approached
Asgard; and he would certainly have overtaken them
but for a stratagem of the Aser, who were anxiously
watching the pursuit. Forming a vast pile of faggots
under the walls of the city, they set fire to it; and the
flames ascended so high as to burn the eagle’s wings.
Thiasse fell to the ground, and was immediately despatched
by Thor.</p>

<p class='c024'>This is one of the most interesting fables of the
prose Edda. It has doubtless a meaning, though we
are by no means sure that Magnussen has discovered
the right one. According to him, Iduna is the spring,
which may be called the renewer of nature’s youth.
Spring is always accompanied by joy and harmony,—by
the song of birds, by the cheerful hum of men, by
the gambols of animals, by the sportive winds: hence
it is personified in Iduna: she is the wife of Braga, the
god of poetry, of music, of song, of harmony. Thiasse,
the giant, is the winter: Iduna flies from him in the
shape of the swallow, which is everywhere the bird of
spring. The destruction of the giant by the flames,
denotes the season of winter killed by the heat of the
spring.—That this explanation of the mythos is ingenious,
as well as plausible, cannot be denied; but we
are not quite satisfied with it. Though a meaning is
involved in these fables, we doubt whether all the incidents
are thus designed. Many were invented through
the love of invention, or rather to please the multitude;
and by such inventors physical principles would
not always be observed. For this obvious reason,
much caution is requisite in interpretations which have
not positive authority for their base.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The next mythos in which Loke is exhibited, is in
connection with Thor.</p>

    <div>THOR’S VISITS TO UTGARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Geyruth, also called Geirrod, was one of the Aser’s
most formidable enemies. In the former volume we
have given, from Saxo Grammaticus, a description of
his empire<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c023'><sup>[67]</sup></a>,—a description rivalling in power of invention
any to be found in Homer. To it we refer the
reader, before he proceeds any farther with this narrative,
as nothing can be more curious than to compare
the account which Saxo derived from tradition (no
Edda had then been compiled), and, what is more, from
Danish tradition, with that given in the sacred books of
the Scandinavians from Norwegian sources.</p>

<p class='c024'>Thor’s first journey was preceded by that of Loke.
Loke, with all his cunning, was frequently in trouble;—and
how could the devil be otherwise? Assuming a
hawk’s disguise, (the hawk in more countries than the
North was the symbol of that personage,) he entered the
dominions of Geyruth, was caught, and, when he refused
to answer the questions that were put to him, was shut
up in a chest during three months. His revenge then
gave way, and he confessed who he was. The giant
then released him, on his promise to bring Thor to
Utgard, without belt or hammer. The object of the
giant’s policy may be easily guessed. Thor, the defender
of Asgard, the everlasting enemy of the giants, would be
reduced to the same level with themselves when deprived
of those wonderful treasures. Loke had no difficulty
in prevailing on the stout-hearted god to visit the dominions
of the giant king. On the way to that region,
within the boundaries of Utgard, was a magic forest,
of which the trees were all iron. It was inhabited
by certain enchantresses, who were the mothers of
male and female sorcerers, who could at any time
assume the wolf’s shape. These enchantresses were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>cruel: they often raised storms, and enticed travellers
into their power from the mere love of destruction.
Thor met one of these witches, who cautioned him
against the arts of Geyruth, and presented him with a
pair of iron gloves, a girdle, and a staff.</p>

<p class='c024'>On reaching the river Vimur, the longest one in the
world, he observed Gialp, one of the giant’s daughters,
standing astride the whole river,—one foot on each
bank; and making the water rise in a fearful manner.
He threw a rush at her, and forced her to retire.
Wading across, he proceeded to Geyruth’s palace,
which he entered, and a separate lodging was provided
for him. In one corner of the cavern was a stool, on
which he sat down; but scarcely was he seated, when
the stool began to rise from the ground. With the
staff which he held, he struck the roof of the cave, and
immediately heard a loud scream beneath him. On
looking, he discovered, with broken backs, three daughters
of his host, who had placed themselves on the roof with
the design of crushing him to death. Geyruth himself
did not escape more easily. Inviting Thor to drink
with him, the two sat down in another part of the palace,
one on each side of a large fire. Having sat for
some time, the giant seized a red-hot iron wedge that
was glowing in the fire, and threw it with all his might
at the god. The latter caught it with his gloved hand,
and returned it with such force, that though Geyruth
had run behind a pillar, it went through both pillar,
himself, and the walls of the palace. Still it remained
in his breast; and in that position, attended by his three
maimed daughters, he has remained ever since.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c023'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>In the second journey, which is much more imaginative,
Thor was accompanied by Loke. The temple
of Upsal had been visited by Utgardelok (the demon
king of Utgard)<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c023'><sup>[69]</sup></a>, who had not only extinguished
the sacred fire, but made a ruin of the edifice. Now
Upsal was the palace which, above all others in
Midgard, Odin loved. In it Thor and Frigga too were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>worshipped with great pomp; and the priestesses of the
latter were of royal blood,—the daughters of kings.
Great was the wrath of the three deities. Thor, in particular,
was observed to knit his brows, and to clench his
fist at table: but he spoke not a word; for he was revolving
the means of vengeance. Formidable as he
knew the demon king to be in natural, and still more
in supernatural power,—in a science unknown to the
gods,—he resolved to invade his dominions. Having
emptied a full horn presented to him by one of the
Valkyrs, he called for his car, for his goats, and for
Loke, as the companion of his journey. Having harnessed
the animals, nailed on their golden shoes, wound
the reins round his waist, he entered with Loke; and
grasping Miölner in his right hand, proceeded at a rapid
pace down the bridge Bifrost.</p>

<p class='c021'>Reaching a cottage towards nightfall, they asked for
hospitality, which was readily granted. Humble was
the cot; and it contained little for gods to banquet on,—nothing
but simple vegetables. But Thor was not
anxious on this account. With his hammer he slew his
two goats, which were skinned and roasted with considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>despatch. Ample was the entertainment; not
only was the flesh delicious, but the place teemed with
excellent mead; and some idea may be formed of a divine
appetite, when we add, that the two goats were entirely
devoured,—all but the bones, which Thor desired
should be carefully thrown back into the skins that were
stretched before the hearth. But Thialf, a son of the
rustic host, and a mere stripling, broke a thigh-bone
of one goat for the sake of the marrow. The next
morning, before daybreak, Thor arose, and swung his
hammer over the two skins, when suddenly the two
goats rose up as if nothing had happened. But one of
them limped; and dreadful was the countenance of
the god. Supplication, however, disarmed him; he
took the youth and a sister into his service; and leaving
the car and the goats at the peasant’s cottage, all
four proceeded on foot. The boy, who immediately won
the favour of his master, carried a wallet; and the
maiden, quite a beauty, tripped lightly along. Thor
marched pensively; his hammer flung over his shoulder;
his dark locks escaping from his silvery casque. They
reached the sea, which was agitated by a dreadful tempest;
and Loke began to be afraid; but he was compelled
to follow the god, who rushed into the water, like
some thundering rock. The mortals too followed: but
the storm continued to rage; and they required all the
help of the leader to reach the other side. A trackless
desert was next to be traversed; and on they went, in
darkness, except that the moon now and then gleamed,—weary,
hungry, wet, and faint. Other trials were
to be encountered,—the storm, the lightning, the slippery
ice, the deep mud; the roaring wind, which the
demon king excited by his magic power. Thor, who
had to support the maiden Roska, lost his temper; and
he vowed revenge on Utgardelok when he should meet
him. What seemed to be a hut, in the midst of the
pitiless waste, presented itself; and three of them entered
it, Thor himself remaining at the entrance with
his mallet in his hand, to protect them while they slept.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Vast, and of a strange form, was the only apartment
which the hut contained; but in a storm any port is
welcome. Towards morning, while Thor glanced in
great anger over the waste, he heard a strange noise, and
felt a strange motion. Rising, he beheld, by the faint
glimmer of the moon, a vast giant—so vast as to cover
several acres—asleep and snoring. Grasping his mallet,
he was preparing to punish the intruder, when up
started the giant. “Who are you?” demanded Thor.
“Skrymner, the servant of king Utgardelok, just come
from Jotunheim.” He addressed Thor by name, of whose
feats he had heard much; but common report, he
thought, had been too favourable; for after all, even <i>he</i>,
who was of little esteem compared with his fellows,
could put this hero of the gods in the palm of his right
hand. “I have lost my gauntlet!” suddenly observed
the giant, who groping for it, took it up. What was it
but the strange hut in which Loke and the two mortals
had passed the greater part of the night? All but Thor
were dismayed at this commencement of their acquaintance
with the subjects of Utgardelok; but Thor trusted
in his hammer. “What brings you so far to look at a
desert?” was the natural question of Skrymner. Thor
replied, that he was determined to see, face to face, their
boasted monarch, whose magic and frozen mountains he
only ridiculed. The giant thought he might rue his
boldness: however, if he was determined to proceed, let
him do so, and he (Skrymner) would be his guide.
When evening came, and the giant laid down to sleep
under a great tree, until supper was ready, there was
more magic. Neither Thialf, nor Loke, nor Thor himself,
could open the wallet, or cut the strings. In
great wrath the god seized his hammer, and struck at
the forehead of the sleeping giant. “Has a leaf fallen
on my face?” asked the giant, rubbing his face, and
wondering why they had not gone to sleep. Towards
midnight, the snoring of Skrymner so enraged Thor,
that he arose, and aimed a hard and more vigorous blow
at the monster: the hammer seemed to enter his very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>brain. “Has an acorn fallen?” was the cool observation
of the other, as he rubbed his face. A third blow,
which seemed to send the very handle into the giant’s
head, had no better effect; so that Thor now began to
have less confidence in the weapon which had hitherto
terrified all created things.</p>

<p class='c024'>But we must not dwell on events which have been
so frequently described.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c023'><sup>[73]</sup></a> The adventures of the god
and his companions at the palace of Utgardelok were
not such as to inspire him with more confidence. Loke—fire
itself, which consumes all things—was beat at
eating. Thialf—a mythologic personage too, though
represented as a peasant’s son, his name signifying
<i>thought</i>—is exceeded in the race. The mighty thunderer
himself is vanquished in three successive trials.
Though he is the sun, the greatest drinker surely in all
nature, he cannot much lessen a large horn of liquor that
is presented to him: he cannot lift a huge tom-cat
from the floor: he cannot, in wrestling, throw a toothless
old woman, who brings him on one knee. In much
shame, though in no consternation, the god returned
with his companions. On leaving the confines of the
city, however, he was made acquainted with the deceptions
that had been practised on him. The three blows
which he had struck, were not at a head, but at a rocky
mountain; and deep were the dells which they had
made in it. The horn was the ocean; yet he had drunk
so much of it as to leave in many places land instead of
water. The cat was Midgard’s great serpent, which
he had almost lifted from the sea. The old woman
was Hela, the goddess of death, who with all her strength
could only bring him on one knee. In great anger, he
was going to exact revenge for such tricks, when the
spectre and the city itself vanished like mist.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>This mythos in a great degree explains itself. The
contest between Thor and Utgard’s monarch is evidently
one between the summer and the winter, between
heat and cold, between light and darkness. Many of the
details, we believe, in opposition to Magnussen, who sees
in every thing a physical meaning, to have been created
without any other design than entertainment.</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Hymis-quida</i>, a song about Hymir, is from the elder
Edda, and is of great antiquity.</p>

    <div>THOR AND THE GIANT HYMIR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The sea-god Ægir gave a banquet to the gods; but
he was little prepared for such drinkers, and his mead
fell short. Thor called for more with some anger; and
that anger was not diminished when he found that no
more was forthcoming. The excuse was, that Ægir
had not a cauldron large enough to brew sufficient mead
at a time. Tyr, who was present with the rest, and
who, though a god, is represented as the son of the giant
Hymir, observed that his father had one a mile deep,
which might be obtained by stratagem. On this business
the two gods immediately departed in the chariot
of Thor towards Hymir’s abode, which lay on the
confines of the eastern sea. Here they found two
ladies, the mother and wife of the giant; the former
a strange creature, with 900 heads; the latter, who was
the mother of Tyr, a fine woman, and kind as she was
comely. She told them both that she feared Hymir’s
return; since he was subject to dreadful passions; and
she hid them behind some kettles. Towards evening
he returned, in no good humour. As he entered the
house, the icy mountains emitted a thundering noise.
An old man he was to view, and the hairs of his head,
which resembled a forest, were frozen. His wife, saluting
him, told him that their son was arrived, in company
with the famous enemy of the giants and the
friend of men, Veor.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c023'><sup>[74]</sup></a> “Look,” she added, “where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>they sit, at the extremity of the house, to avoid thy
glance!” The giant looked; but they were concealed
by the nine kettles. At his glance, however, the tree
or beam from which they were suspended, burnt
into two, and eight of them burst. The two gods
now advanced; and though Hymir was compelled to
exercise some degree of hospitality, he did so unwillingly.
Three oxen (one for each, we suppose, unless
the lion’s share was to be Hymir’s,) were ordered to
be roasted. But Thor showed that he had more than
a giant’s appetite; for, to the surprise of his host, he
ate two of the animals himself. This made the latter
observe, that the next evening the two visitors must eat
what they could take in hunting or fishing for themselves.
The next day, therefore, Thor proposed to
fish, if the giant would give him bait. “Go amongst
the cattle, and seize one,” was the reply. “I suspect,
however,” Hymir added, “that thou wilt not easily
catch such bait.” Without reply, Thor went into the
wood, and seizing the horns of a large black bull, pulled
off its head, and returned to the giant, who expressed
some surprise at such a feat in one so little. They
now went out into the sea, and the giant hauled two
whales. But nobler was the prey of Thor: with the
bull’s head he caught the great serpent Jormungandur,
the head of which he drew out of the water, and which
spewed venom upon him. The rocks trembled; the
desert places howled, and the ancient earth rolled itself
closer. He then struck the monster with his mallet,
and it sank. Hymir rowed back, sullen and silent; and
the strength which had been exhibited in bringing the
two whales to his mountain home, gave him some reason
for thought. When returned, the two gods were desired
to try their strength in other things. A cup was
put into the hands of Thor, and he was defied to
break it. In vain did he dash it against several pillars
in succession: he split <i>them</i>, but <i>it</i> remained unbroken.
The wife now whispered him to throw it against the
giant’s head, which was much harder than the rock.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>He did so; the head was uninjured; but the cup was
broken, and the owner lamented its loss. The next
trial of strength was to carry the great cauldron out of
the house. Tyr tried twice; but could not so much as
move it. But Thor placed it upon his head; and
though the edges descended to his heels, he walked
away with it. He was now pursued by a great number
of giants whom he slew with his mallet.—From that
time the sea-god was able to treat the Aser men to
their satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c024'>Of this mythos the physical meaning is dark; and
this darkness is probably owing to the fondness with
which the northern scalds added extraneous circumstances
for the sake of embellishment. Nothing, indeed,
is more hopeless than the attempt to restore these
ancient pieces to the original fragmentary state in
which they were left by the priests of Thor and of
Odin. The scald has, by embellishing, concealed the
priest; the fabulist concealed the philosophic theologian.
All that we can safely assert is, that there is here a physical
contest between heat and cold, between evaporation and
congelation; that the sun (Thor), having drunk up all
the streams of the earth, now invades the dominions of
frost and snow. The bursting of the vessels under the
glance of Hymir, is a notion universally diffused in
the northern latitudes. Thus, the two magicians the
suitors of Gunhilda, could destroy every thing by
their glance.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c023'><sup>[75]</sup></a> The meaning doubtless is, that excessive
frost makes every thing brittle, and may therefore
be said to split every thing.</p>

<p class='c024'>If the scalds took such liberties with the ancient or
poetic Edda, as often to bury the sun, they were more
licentious still in regard to the younger or prose Edda.
This work was evidently compiled to explain the
former. With <i>it</i> a licence still more dangerous has
been taken; so that, in many instances, it bears little
conformity with the preceding work. We may add,
that by modernising, paraphrasing, and embellishing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>prose Edda, Ohlenschlager has done no service to the
ancient mythology of his country: he cannot be followed
by any one that would form a correct notion of
the subject. In the same manner as the compilers of
the second Edda deviated from the spirit of the first,
so has the celebrated Danish poet deviated from <i>them</i>.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c023'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
For the sake of illustrating this divergence, let us advert
for a moment to the same adventure in the prose
Edda and in the version of Ohlenschlager: it will be
found to have lost its mythical character in proportion
to the improvement of its fable.</p>

<p class='c024'>When Thor reflected on the gross impositions which
Utgardelok had practised on him, he was apprehensive,
and not without reason, that gods and men would take
him for a fool. To vindicate his merits, he ventured
again to visit Utgard, and without Loke, whose honour
he justly suspected. This time he would, like them,
change his form, and he obtained from Odin, in the
shape of ointment, power that would enable him to do
so. Leaving behind his car and his goats—</p>

<p class='c021'>“The poet in describing Hymir’s residence gives a vivid picture
of Norwegian scenery, black rugged rocks crowned with
pines, a waterfall, a river white with foam dashing through thick
brushwood down the ravine, and hard by a verdant dell filled
with cattle. On hearing a stranger’s step, Hymir sprang up,

a wild bull rushing towards him, he seized it by the horns
and brake off its head, and then throwing it over his shoulders
leaped the enclosure, and hastened to Hymir, who was getting

</div>

<p class='c035'>“It must be confessed,” says the prose Edda, “that Thor
here made quite as great a fool of Jormungandur as Utgard’s-Lok
did of him, when the giant king caused him to lift up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the worm, believing it was a cat. The worm gulped down
the ox’s head so ravenously, that the hook stuck deep in his
jaws. As soon as he perceived this, he plunged with such
violence, that both Thor’s fists struck against the sides of the
boat, on which the god’s anger got up and his strength at the
same time, and he pulled so furiously against the snake, that
both his legs went through the boat, and he remained standing
on the bottom of the sea. He now pulled up the serpent to
the edge of the boat, and, to say the truth, it was a terrible
sight to see Thor look so grim at the serpent, and the serpent
all the while gaping and spewing out poison against
Thor. It is reported also that the giant Hymir changed
colour, and became white with fear, when he saw the snake,
and the dark blue sea breaking through the sides of the boat.</p>

<p class='c036'>“In the same moment Thor seized hold of his hammer and
swung it round in the air, but the giant fumbled about for
his knife, and scored Thor’s knot over, by which means the
snake got loose and sank down to the bottom of the sea. Thor
threw his hammer after it, and it has been asserted that he
thus knocked its head off against the breakers. But I think
that it is pretty certain that the Midgard’s worm still lives
and lies in the sea. Thor then lifted his arm and gave Hymir
such a cuff on the side of the head that he fell overboard, and
the soles of his feet were turned up in the air, but Thor waded
to shore.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c023'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The contrast between the preceding version and the
simple relation in the venerable poetic Edda will, no
doubt, appear striking to the reader, and abundantly
confirm all the observations we have made on the subject.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THOR AND THE GIANT THRYM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The poem of <i>Thrym’s-guida</i>, or the song about Thrym,
in the elder Edda, has a physical meaning, though that
meaning is dark. Awaking one morning, Thor could
not find his hammer. Like Jove he shook his head and
his beard, and groped about in every direction. Calling
Loke to him, he said, “Here is a mishap, never
before known in earth or heaven,—I have lost my
hammer!” No doubt but it had been stolen during
the night by one of the giants, who were always on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>alert to injure the Aser. Both gods then went to Freya,
to borrow her hawk’s-dress, as Loke had before borrowed
it to recover Iduna.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c023'><sup>[81]</sup></a> “And thou should’st have
it,” replied the goddess, “if it were gold, nay, if it
were even silver.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c023'><sup>[82]</sup></a> Loke assumed the dress, and flew
into the giant region of Utgard. There he found
Thrym, one of Utgard’s lords, making golden collars
for his dogs, dressing the manes of his horses, and
singing all the time. Seeing Loke, he inquired, “What
news of the Aser? What of the elves? What brings
thee alone to Jotunheim?” “Neither Aser nor elves
are very well, just now:—hast thou hidden Thor’s
hammer?” “That I have, eight miles below the
earth’s surface; and regain it shall you never, unless
you bring me the goddess Freya to wife!” The condition
was a hard one. Freya was the queen of love;
she was the Venus of Asgard; and she was also the
moon,—two things much wanted in the cold dark region
of Jotunheim. Away flew Loke, his wings resounding,
until he reached Asgard, where he was anxiously
met by Thor. “Hast thou been to Giant-land?
And hast thou succeeded in thine errand?” “I have
been to Giant-land, and I have succeeded in my errand.
Thrym, the lord of the frost giants, has thy mallet,
and thy mallet he will not restore, unless he has
Freya to wife!” The loss of Freya would be a great
loss, but that of the thunderbolt was worse; for how
without it could Asgard be defended against the giants?
Away went the two gods to Freya, and the Thunderer
most unceremoniously bade her to prepare herself for a
husband, and for a ride to Jotunheim:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Angry was Freya,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she trembled (with rage),</div>
      <div class='line'>The whole palace of the gods</div>
      <div class='line'>Was shaken.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The gods and goddesses were now assembled to deliberate
on other means of recovering the hammer.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Heimdall proposed that Thor himself should assume
the bridal dress, with the habit and ornaments of Freya,
and proceed to Jotunheim:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Let us make on him</div>
      <div class='line'>The keys to jingle<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c023'><sup>[83]</sup></a>;</div>
      <div class='line'>And a woman’s dress</div>
      <div class='line'>To flow below his knees;</div>
      <div class='line'>And on his breast</div>
      <div class='line'>The jewell’d ornaments;</div>
      <div class='line'>And let us put on him</div>
      <div class='line'>The handsome head-gear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Thor did not much relish the proposal, from a fear
that the gods would hereafter hold him to be degraded,—would
regard him as really a woman. Loke told
him, however, that he had only to choose between the
mode of recovering his mallet, and of seeing Asgard in
possession of the giants. He then suffered himself
to be conveyed in the manner proposed. Then spake
Loke, the son of Laufeya:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I as thy servant</div>
      <div class='line'>With thee will go:</div>
      <div class='line'>We together will ride</div>
      <div class='line'>To the land of the giants.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The chariot was brought out, the goats were yoked,
and the two Aser rapidly proceeded to their destination,—so
rapidly, that the rocks split, and the earth blazed
under the shining wheels:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then spake Thrym,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lord of the Thurser<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c023'><sup>[84]</sup></a>;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Arise, ye giants,</div>
      <div class='line'>And strew the benches.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then bring unto me</div>
      <div class='line'>Freya my bride,</div>
      <div class='line'>The daughter of Niord</div>
      <div class='line'>From Nocturn:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“Bring into the bower</div>
      <div class='line'>The cows with golden horns,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the coal-black oxen,</div>
      <div class='line'>The giant’s delight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Many jewels have I</div>
      <div class='line'>And many treasures:</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Freya alone</div>
      <div class='line'>Have I need.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The giants arrived, and the bridal feast was prepared.
Great was the surprise of Thrym to see his bride eat a
whole ox, and eight salmon into the bargain; and to
send after all three barrels of mead:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Who ever saw a bride</div>
      <div class='line'>Eat so greedily?</div>
      <div class='line'>Never did I see one</div>
      <div class='line'>Devour so much;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor any virgin</div>
      <div class='line'>Swill so much mead!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The reply of Loke, disguised as a handmaid, was
ready:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Nothing has Freya tasted</div>
      <div class='line'>These eight nights (days),<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c023'><sup>[85]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>So great was her desire</div>
      <div class='line'>To be in Jotunheim.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The giant in a gallant style wished to kiss his bride;
but no sooner did he lift the veil, and see her looks,
than he started back in great alarm:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why so angry</div>
      <div class='line'>The glance of Freya?</div>
      <div class='line'>I see from her eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>The very fire doth issue.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The reply of Loke, the handmaid, was equally ready:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“No sleep hath Freya had</div>
      <div class='line'>These eight nights:</div>
      <div class='line'>Such was her longing</div>
      <div class='line'>To visit Jotunheim!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>The giant’s sister came for a bridal present, and one
she was about to get that she little expected. The
mallet, by Thrym’s command, was now brought forth,
that the wedding might be solemnised over it. The
god laughed as he grasped his well-known bolt; and
no sooner did he grasp it than he killed Thrym, the
sister, and all assembled.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c023'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>According to Magnussen, the physical meaning of the
poem is this. During the winter, Thor, the god of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>thunder, sleeps; and Thrym, the lord of that season,
hides the thunderbolt. Loke (<i>flame</i>, and by an extension
of the metaphor, <i>heat</i>) is sent in pursuit of it.
The sun and moon were very meet and very natural
gifts for the inhabitants of the dark region to solicit
from the gods; and the world, on the present occasion,
must have been left in darkness, or rather perhaps in
cold, but for the interference of Thor. In the foundation
of his theory, the critic is doubtless correct; but
in the explanation of the attendant circumstances,—that
in which the god assumes the female habit—he is
whimsical enough. The truth is, that the foundation
only can be traced in any of their myths: the circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>are introduced purely for the sake of the embellishment,
or for ensuring greater probability to the
fable.</p>

<p class='c024'>Before we dismiss Thor, we must advert to the goddess
<i>Sif</i>, his wife. The word means a conjunction,
kindred, and probably she was one of his family. By
her he had two sons, Magne and Mode, and two daughters,
Thrude and Lora. He was not her first husband,
whose name does not appear; but she had a son named
Uller by that husband.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c023'><sup>[92]</sup></a> She excelled in chastity, and
was much worshipped, not in Scandinavia only, but
among the Vends, and perhaps the Slavonians, as a personification
of the summer-earth. Her greatest pride
is her fair hair, which, like the hammer of Thor, and
the magic ring possessed by Odin, was the work of the
dwarfs. She is thus described by Ohlenschlager:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sif, tall and fair with native grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>To none in beauty need give place</div>
      <div class='line'>Save her whom Odin called to light,</div>
      <div class='line'>To make the erst dull world more bright.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fair tho’ she be, to Freya ne’er</div>
      <div class='line'>Can stately Sif in form compare.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Not her’s the clear eye’s speaking glance,</div>
      <div class='line'>Age-frozen blood might make to dance:</div>
      <div class='line'>Or heart which passion ne’er had felt</div>
      <div class='line'>Like snow ’neath mid-day sun to melt.</div>

      <div class='line'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sif seems some Amazon to be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her look replete with dignity,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her eye beams no impassioned glance,</div>
      <div class='line'>But rests in cold indifference.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her round arms, form’d alike to prove</div>
      <div class='line'>The contests or of war or love;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her swan-like bosom’s faultless curve</div>
      <div class='line'>Would Bragi’s golden lyre deserve.</div>
      <div class='line'>Smaller though Freya’s hand, not snow</div>
      <div class='line'>Than Sifs, fresh fallen on mountain brow,</div>
      <div class='line'>More white, nor softer virgin down</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Eyder-fowl, nor breast of swan.</div>
      <div class='line'>Two pencill’d brows of darkest brown</div>

    <div>NIORD, FREYR, FREYA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Niord, a lord of the Vaner, obtained, as we have
before related<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c023'><sup>[93]</sup></a>, a share in the government of the Aser.
He could not, indeed, do otherwise after the junction of
the two people. Mythologically, he is the lord of Vindheim,
the region of the winds, and consequently the
ally of Ægir, the god of the sea. His palace, Noatun,
is represented as on the borders of the ocean. Thus,
Ohlenschlager, who may be followed where poetical
description merely is required:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Niord who with ocean’s god</div>
      <div class='line'>Full oft in league is found,</div>
      <div class='line'>Loves o’er the raging flood</div>
      <div class='line'>In swift career to bound.</div>
      <div class='line'>Skimming each billow’s back,</div>
      <div class='line'>Loud neighs his coal-black steed:</div>
      <div class='line'>On the calm wave no track</div>
      <div class='line'>He leaves—so great his speed.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c023'><sup>[94]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Niord was twice married. By his first wife, who
was also his sister, and we are distinctly informed that
the union of such near relatives was peculiar to the
Vanir (the custom, however, was common to the Egyptians,
the Persians, and the royal family of Peru), he had
two children, Freyr<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c023'><sup>[95]</sup></a> and Freya.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c023'><sup>[96]</sup></a> His second wife
was Skada, daughter of the giant Thiasse. The circumstances
which led to his marriage were these. No
sooner did Skada hear that her father had been killed
by Thor<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c023'><sup>[97]</sup></a>, than she armed herself, and proceeded to
Asgard to avenge his death. As the condition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>peace, the gods proposed that she should take a husband
from them, but that, while choosing, she should be
blindfolded. She groped about, and at length fixed on one
whose feet were small and well formed, whom she thought
to be Balder. It was Niord; and the marriage was celebrated.
The pair, however, could not agree about
their place of residence. The bride could not bear the
sea-shore; the waves, she observed, would not let her
sleep, and she longed for her native mountains. He
was no less hostile to her father’s abode. A compromise
was at length effected; the couple were to live
nine days in Thrymheim, and three days in Noatun;
that is, nine days in the mountains, and three on the
sea-coast. But this compromise was of no long duration.
The two were so dissimilar in character that
they could not agree; there was a separation; and
Skada became the wife of Odin.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c023'><sup>[98]</sup></a> Of Niord we shall
only add that though little is said of him in the Edda,
he must have been a primary deity from the terms of the
oath solemnly taken by the Scandinavians:—“So help
me Freyr, and Niord, and the mighty Aser!”</p>

<p class='c024'>Freyr, the son of Niord, has been mentioned as one
of the twelve ruling gods of Asgard—as god of sunshine,
of rain, and consequently of vegetation. Alfheim,
his residence, the kingdom of the light elves, was given
him in the morning of time, when he had cut his first
tooth. One day he had the presumption to ascend
Lidskialf, the awful seat of Odin<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c023'><sup>[99]</sup></a>; and he was
punished for it by falling in love with Gerda, daughter
of the giant Gymer, whom he saw issue from her father’s
palace in the North. Surpassing, indeed, was the
maiden’s beauty; it was so bright as to enlighten the
whole region. He gazed and loved; and after the
beautiful vision had departed, he descended, melancholy
and miserable, to his own palace. What hope was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>there of winning a giant maiden? Would the gods
themselves sanction such a connection? Sleep and
appetite forsook him. In much anxiety, Niord besought
his confidential messenger, Skirnir, to draw
from Freyr the cause of his affliction. With some
persuasion, Skirnir consented, and by much entreaty
obtained the secret:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From Gymer’s house</div>
      <div class='line'>I have seen a maiden issue</div>
      <div class='line'>For whom I long.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her fair arms shone</div>
      <div class='line'>So as to enlighten air and sea.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dearer is the maid to me</div>
      <div class='line'>Than ever was maid to any youth.</div>
      <div class='line'>But of gods or demigods</div>
      <div class='line'>Not one will wish</div>
      <div class='line'>That we should be united.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Skirnir loves the lord with whom he was reared; and
he proposes, if Freyr will give him the horse “regardless
of flame,” and the sword, to go and win the lady
for him. Having mounted, he thus addressed the animal:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dark is the night without;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet it is time for us to go</div>
      <div class='line'>Through the misty hills,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through the land of the Thurser.</div>
      <div class='line'>We both must return,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or both be seized</div>
      <div class='line'>By the powerful giant.”</div>

<p class='c021'>He rode to Jotunheim, and before the gate of Gymer
saw fierce dogs. On a hill close by was a herdsman,
to whom he rode, and inquired by what means he
might pass the dogs so as to speak with Gymer’s daughter.
The herdsman replied, that he must either be
dead already, or about to die, to venture on such an
errand; never could he speak to the lady. Skirnir
observed, that he could but die; that he feared not
death; and he dismounted. The noise attracted the attention
of Gerda: she caused the stranger to enter, and
thus addressed him:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Who art thou?—of the elves?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or of the Aser sons?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or of the wiser Vaner?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why comest thou hither, alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through raging flames</div>
      <div class='line'>To visit our hall?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>He replied that he was not an Elf, nor an Aser, nor
a Vanir; and he offered her eleven apples,—no doubt
those of immortality, stolen from the treasury of Iduna,<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c023'><sup>[100]</sup></a>—if
she would bestow her love on Freyr, the most
agreeable of all beings. She rejected the apples with
scorn, declaring that she would never live with Freyr.
He then offered her the ring—the very ring—which
was laid on the funeral pyre with Balder, the son of
Odin—that ring which every ninth night produced
eight other rings of the same weight. It too she scorned;
she had gold enough in her father’s house. He then
bade her look at the sword which he held in his hand,
and threatened to behead her unless she would love
Freyr. Still she refused; and said that if he and her
father met, there would be bloodshed. Other threats
he employed, and commenced a charm which was for
ever to deprive her of beauty, of happiness, of worldly
esteem, and consign her to the most direful woes. In
the midst of the charm, she interrupted him; she could
resist no longer; she offered him a cup of mead; and
at length named the very night on which she would
meet Freyr in the grove of Barre.—Skirnir now
returned in great joy. He is met by Freyr, who
will not allow him to dismount until he has said what
success has attended him. The news, which ought to
fill him with joy, makes him impatient. One night
seems long; nine seems an age. The giant-maiden
kept her promise; and for a reward, Skirnir received
the sword of Freyr.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c023'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Freya had an equal share with Odin in the souls of
all slain in fight; for is not love the cause of as much
bloodshed as any other passion? All maidens of birth
also hastened to her palace of Vingolf. Her car was
drawn by two wild cats, or perhaps leopards; and next to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Frigga, with whom she has been often confounded; she
was the most powerful of all the goddesses. Her husband
was Oddur, of whom little is known, except that
he travelled far and wide, and that her attachment to
him induced her to follow him, weeping tears of gold.
Yet, if report be true, she was not always distinguished
for conjugal faith. She had two daughters by Oddur,
both exquisitely fair to behold; and she had four attendants,
to each of whom was intrusted some portion
of her sovereignty. Thus Siofna was the goddess of
first love; Lofna removed all obstacles which impeded
the fruition of lovers’ wishes; Var presided over betrothals,
and punished false vows; Tir, the portress of
Freya’s palace, refused admission to all who were not
qualified to enter; and she was the enemy of all unfortunate
lovers: she it was who prevented the fruition of
their hopes.</p>

<p class='c024'>This mythos explains itself more satisfactorily than
any other.</p>

    <div>ÆGIR AND RAN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Were of giant race, and deities of the deep. They
had nine daughters, personifications of the billows, the
currents, and the storm.</p>

<p class='c024'>Ægir might be propitiated; but Ran was always cruel,
when the fates would permit her: she occasioned shipwrecks
in which she delighted, on account of the spoil
which they brought her. She had a wonderful net,

sea.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>There was a brilliant feast held in the palace of
Ægir, beneath the waves. Gods, goddesses, and elves were
present to honour it; and the great cauldron which
Thor had stolen<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c023'><sup>[114]</sup></a> contained mead enough for all
the guests. This feast, therefore, was subsequent
to the other, when the want of that liquor was resented
by Thor. On this occasion Thor was not present, but
Loke was; yet no welcome guest was he. The deities
did not like him; first, because he had a wicked tongue,
and next, because he had but too much reason for using
it at their expense. Two of the sea-gods, attendants,
obtaining from all the praise of dexterity, Loke killed
one of them, merely because he could not bear to hear
any one commended. In great anger the gods excluded
him from the festive hall; but he, at length, returned,
and asked for his place, not in a penitential mood, but
in the resolution of creating strife. All seemed inclined
to reject him, until he won upon Odin by reminding
him of past times:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Rememberest thou, Odin,</div>
      <div class='line'>How, in the morning of time,</div>
      <div class='line'>We mixed blood together?<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c023'><sup>[115]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>To taste of liquor</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou swarest never,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unless it were brought to us both.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The sire of gods was moved by this appeal; and
he cried—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Arise, Vidar,</div>
      <div class='line'>And let the wolf’s father</div>
      <div class='line'>Take his place at the board!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>He did take his place; and as each of the guests remonstrated
with him on his ill-nature, he launched out
into new abuse. He spared none; and though his reproaches
were bitter, they had foundation enough to
render them keenly felt. Neither the awful dignity
of Odin, nor the thunderbolt of Thor, who arrived
about the midst of the festival, could shield them from
his attacks. We have not space for the alleged vices of
the dwellers in the Scandinavian Olympus; but his
abuse made the gods inwardly resolve to effect his
destruction whenever the opportunity occurred. His
share in the death of Balder (to which we shall soon
advert) hastened the time.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>OTHER DEITIES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The three Nornies, Urda, Verdandi, and Skula,
are celebrated in Scandinavian mythology. Of them
we have before spoken, and have little to add here.
Their origin was unknown. They appear to have sprung
up with the great tree Yggdrasil, and to have been dependent
only on the mysterious Al-fader. They were said
to have more sympathy than destined beings would be
expected to have, and to have wept over the fall of their
favourites. Both Urda and Skula were frequently consulted
by the gods, who were ignorant of their own
fate.</p>

<p class='c024'>Besides these there were inferior Nornies among the
elves and the dwarfs.</p>

<p class='c024'><i>Night</i> and <i>Day</i> (Nott and Dagr) were also deified; so
was the horse <i>Rimfaxi</i> (frost-mane), which carried night,
and the horse <i>Skinfaxi</i> (bright mane), which drew the
car of day. Dew is merely foam which falls from the
bits of the former horse. Night was the daughter of
the great Norvè; and being married to the god Delling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>(the dawn) the offspring was Day. There is some
poetry in the following description from the poetic Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Delling’s son (<i>day</i>) forth</div>

      <div class='line'>The courser’s mane,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who drew in his car</div>
      <div class='line'>The baffler of Dualin (<i>day</i>).</div>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>Gates of the north,</div>

      <div class='line'>To rest now glided</div>
      <div class='line'>Giantesses and giants,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ghosts and dwarfs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dark-alfs.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Heroes arose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Alf-beamer (<i>sun</i>) got up:</div>
      <div class='line'>Northwards to Niflheim,</div>
      <div class='line'>Night is flown.</div>
      <div class='line'>On Argiöll (<i>rainbow</i>) stood</div>
      <div class='line'>Ulfruna’s son (<i>Heimdall</i>),</div>
      <div class='line'>The great horn-sounder</div>
      <div class='line'>Of heaven’s hill.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The deity of winter was the giant <i>Hrsnelgar</i>, who
dwelt in a cavern towards the dreary pole, and from
whose wings comes the bleak north wind. Thus the
Vafthrudnis-mal:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The giant Hrsnelger</div>
      <div class='line'>At Heaven’s extremity</div>
      <div class='line'>Sits under an eagle’s form.</div>
      <div class='line'>From his wings, ’tis said,</div>
      <div class='line'>The cold winds sweep</div>
      <div class='line'>Over all nations.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>This is the giant whom Thorkil saw in the cave.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c023'><sup>[116]</sup></a>
In two or three places there is also allusion to a summer
god, <i>Sfosoder</i>, the sweet, the pleasant; a contrast
with Hrsnelgar, the devourer of carrion.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>The Valkyrs, the elves, and dwarfs, having been
already described, all that now remains is to relate the
circumstances which will precede and accompany the
destruction of the world. Many of them have a connection
with the fate of</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>BALDER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>On this personage <i>historically</i>—if indeed there ever
was one of this name and character—we have already
dwelt<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c023'><sup>[117]</sup></a>; we have now to consider him <i>mythologically</i>.</p>

<p class='c024'>Balder had fearful dreams, and he believed that
something dreadful was impending over him. He
consulted his mother Frigga, who, though a prophetess,
could not interpret his dreams, or foresee the kind of
danger that was at hand. The gods were assembled;
and as from ancient oracles they had learned how
their fate was linked with his, they were the
more anxious for the result. But all was darkness.
Odin cut Runes in vain. Thrain and Dain, two dwarfs
who excelled all beings in Runic wisdom, could only
say that the dream was heavy, and that it portended
evil. At this time Iduna was in the power of Thiasse<a href='#f117' class='c023'><sup>[117]</sup></a>,
but she must be consulted, for she was a great prophetess.
Heimdall, Loke, and Braga went to Jotunheim
for that purpose. As she groaned for the joys of
Asgard, the gods out of pity had previously sent her a
wolf’s skin, by clothing herself in which she forgot the
past. Why then should the three Aser proceed on their
monstrous horses to her abode? Her only reply was
by tears, which, though they proved that she dreaded,
also proved that she knew not the cause of that dread.
Again were the Aser convoked; and it was then resolved
that Frigga should exact from every thing an oath not
to injure Balder. But how could destiny be averted?
She overlooked the Mistletoe.</p>

<p class='c024'>At this crisis, when the future was impenetrable to
the most prophetic of gods and dwarfs, Odin descended to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>consult the awful Vala, whose tomb lay on the confines
of Helheim. His descent we have before related.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c023'><sup>[118]</sup></a> He
returned to Asgard with the certainty that nothing
could avert the fate of his beloved son, or that of the
gods, of whose ruin it was the forerunner.</p>

<p class='c024'>In the work of destiny, Loke, as might be expected,
was the most active agent. He it was who drew from
Frigga the secret of the Mistletoe; he it was who directed
the blind Hoder to cast it; he it was who after Hela
had consented to release Balder from her empire, if all
creatures would lament for him, either persuaded the
giant-woman to refuse, or personated one himself.</p>

<p class='c024'>That this mythos of Balder—one of the most celebrated
in the whole range of Scandinavian lore—has
a physical meaning, is evident: it denotes the departure
of the summer sun from the northern hemisphere.
Some of the circumstances, however, have not been
happily explained; and for the reason that we have
more than once assigned,—that they never can be
explained, since they were invented, not on physical
principles, but to embellish the fable, and render it more
interesting.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>PUNISHMENT OF LOKE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The crimes of Loke were now full; and the gods
determined to suffer them no longer. Their vengeance
fell, first, on his two sons, Nari and Vali. The latter
being changed into a wolf, devoured his brother. With
some difficulty Loke himself was taken by Thor, and,
like Prometheus, bound to the flinty rocks. If he has
not a vulture to feed on his entrails, he has something
quite as bad,—a serpent hung over his head, which
every moment drips its venom. More fortunate, however,
than his prototype, he has a wife, Signi, who
perpetually watches by his side, and building a large
basin, catches the venom intended for him. But at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>intervals she is obliged to empty the basin; and when
she does so, his agony, owing to the poison falling on
his unprotected face, is the cause of earthquakes.
There, like his monstrous offspring, the serpent<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c023'><sup>[119]</sup></a> and
the wolf<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c023'><sup>[120]</sup></a>, he must remain until Ragnarok, the twilight of
the gods, when he and they and the whole visible universe
will be destroyed.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>RAGNAROK, THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Of this consummation, so much dreaded by gods
and elves and giants and men, the prose Edda gives
the following account:—</p>

<p class='c024'>“There will first come a winter which shall be called
Fimbulveter; snow will fall from every quarter, and
hard frost and cutting winds have sway, so that the
heat of the sun will have no influence. Three such
winters, unalleviated by any summer, will follow each
other. Previously to this the whole world will be
scourged, during three winters also, by wars and bloodshed.
Brothers will kill each other through avarice,
and there will be no mercy even from parents to their
children.</p>

<p class='c024'>“And now, to the great affliction of mankind, one
wolf will devour the sun, another the moon, the stars
will disappear from the firmament, the earth quake
violently, trees be torn up by their roots, mountains
fall together, all chains and bonds be burst asunder,
and the wolf Fenris will break loose. Then will the
ocean rise above its shores, for the great Midgard’s
serpent will recover its giant strength, and struggle to
gain the land.</p>

<p class='c024'>“At length he will succeed, the ship Nagelfare will
be set afloat, and the giant Hymir take the helm.
Nagelfare is built of the nails of dead men, and it should
be remarked that when a person dies and his nails are
not cut, materials are furnished towards the building of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>a vessel, whose completion both gods and men should
seek to delay as long as possible.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Fenris now rushes onward open-mouthed; fire
streams from his eyes and nostrils; his under jaw
touches the earth, the upper heaven, and he would open
them still wider if there were space. Jormungandur
vomits out poison, which renders the air and the waters
deadly. He is the most terrible of all, and fights by
the side of the wolf.</p>

<p class='c024'>“In the midst of the confusion the heavens are rent
asunder, and the sons of Muspell (the genii of fire) ride
forth, led on by Surtur, who is clothed in flame, and
whose unrivalled sword surpasses in brightness the sun
itself. The bridge Bifrost gives way beneath their
weight. The sons of Muspell press onwards to the
plain Vigrid, which extends five hundred miles every
way, and where they meet Fenris and Jormungandur.
Asa-Loke also has repaired thither, and at the same
time appears Hymir with the Giants of the Frost. All
the sons of Hela follow Loke.</p>

<p class='c024'>“But now, on the other side, Heimdall rouses himself,
and blowing with all his might on his Gjallar-horn,
wakes up the Aser who hold council as to what is to be
done. Odin rides to Mimer’s well to ascertain what is
best; the Ash Yggdrasil is shaken, and all earth and
heaven are in dismay.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The Aser and Einheirar march to the plain Vigrid,
with Odin at their head. Armed with his golden helm,
his glittering mail and his spear, Gungnir, he encounters
Fenris who swallows him up.</p>

<p class='c021'>This is to finish the visible universe, with its physical

ULTIMATE ESTABLISHMENT IN THE KINGDOMS OF THE NORTH.</p>

<p class='c021'>As the introduction of Christianity into Norway has
been already related, we have briefly to contemplate its
origin and progress in the two sister kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c024'>Nothing can be more obscure than the origin of the
Christian worship in these regions. Probably it was
much more ancient than is generally supposed; but the
number of Christians prior to the ninth century must have
been exceedingly small; and of these most were probably
converts only in name,—joining the adoration of Thor
and Odin with that of Christ. We know that in the
seventh century Anglo-Saxon missionaries endeavoured
to obtain an entrance into Denmark, the contiguity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>which to Frisia, and especially Germany, could not
fail to attract the pious zeal of those excellent men.
St. Wilfrid could do no more than evangelise a few of
the Frisians. His successor, St. Willibrod, who in
696 was consecrated archbishop of the Frisias, passed
into Jutland. Though the mission failed, the prelate
brought away thirty young Danes, whom he designed
to send as missionaries into that barbarous region.
Wherever this venerable man preached, he attempted
to demolish the idols. Even in the sacred island of
Heligoland, where a tempest had cast him, he exhibited
the same undaunted zeal; and on his death in 739, he
had impressed the neighbouring people with much
respect for his character. That he escaped martyrdom,
which seems to have been his aim, can be ascribed only
to that Providence which suffers not a sparrow to fall
unheeded to the ground. But ages are required to
extirpate an old and to plant a new religion. If many
converts were made, they bore little proportion to the
bulk of the population; nor could the salutary effects
be permanent when there was no church, no succession
of missionaries to continue the work. We need not be,
therefore, surprised at the martyrdom of St. Boniface, the
apostle of Germany, in 755. When the victories of
Charlemagne had disposed the Saxons to receive the
yoke of Christ, there was a better opening for the
gospel, not in Saxony only, but in other parts of the
North; for many of the Scandinavians, especially of
Denmark, were in the same great confederation. St.
Sturm contemplated the conversion of Denmark; but he
was prevented by the emperor, who was more anxious
for the progress of the truth in his new conquests than
in more distant regions.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>822 to 826.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>During the reign of Charlemagne, no serious effort
was made to establish a permanent mission in Denmark
or Sweden. Louis le Debonnair had more zeal or better
opportunities; and he readily sanctioned the departure of
Ebbo, archbishop of Rheims. Ebbo was a Saxon, and
more eager for the conversion of the kindred Danes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>than any of the French prelates. Encouraged by a
papal bull, he ventured on the perilous enterprise in
822. Fortunately for him, Harald, surnamed <i>Klak</i>,
who ruled over a portion, at least, of Jutland, had need
of imperial aid to secure himself on the throne. As
the condition of such aid, he agreed not only to become
a vassal of the empire, but to embrace Christianity, and
do all in his power to make his subjects embrace it.
The court of Harald was near the present city of
Sleswic, in the duchy of that name. Ebbo, accompanied
by the monk Halitger, proceeded thither, and
was permitted by the royal consent to preach to the
people. But the fortunes of Harald were diversified;
he was expelled three or four times, and as often
enabled to return, as much through foreign assistance
as through the efforts of his own partisans. That he
was unpopular may easily be inferred from these revolutions
in his fortunes. Of this unpopularity one cause
was doubtless his profession of the new faith; another
was the homage which he had paid to the emperor.
Yet the efforts made by the kings who reigned in Zealand
to create a monarchy, and consequently to destroy
the Reguli, who aimed at independence, was, doubtless,
more injurious to his interests, than the disaffection
of the pagans. But during his intervals of peace, his
patronage of Christianity was serviceable to the cause.
Ebbo naturally left the country when the king was
expelled; and there was danger of the good seed being
choked, when another and more zealous missionary was
raised by divine Providence both to continue the work
which he had begun, and to extend it to Sweden.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>826 to 830.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><i>Anscar</i>, a monk of Corbey in Westphalia, was from
his youth an enthusiastic churchman. He had dreams
and visions, which to him seemed prophetic of his future
martyrdom. For that result he accordingly prepared;
and soon loved to contemplate it as an object of desire
rather than of fear. When, therefore, he heard that
missionaries were required to continue the labour which
Ebbo had abandoned, and to return again with Harald
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>into Denmark, he readily offered himself, and was joyfully
accepted. The perils, indeed, of the enterprise
had no charms for the luxurious ecclesiastics of that
age,—men whom the favours of succeeding monarchs
had enriched; and Anscar with another monk, Aubert,
were the only inmates of the great establishment at
Corbey that could be induced to go. Indeed the
community were not a little amazed to witness the
self-devotion of these missionaries. Leaving Corbey,
the latter repaired into South Jutland. From Harald,
however, they received less assistance than they had
been led to expect. Knowing his unpopularity, he
remained chiefly in a fortress which the emperor had
given him. Of Louis, indeed, he was the vassal, not
for Jutland merely, which might never acknowledge him,
but for the extensive region on the sea-coast, from
Holland to Hamburg. Yet he showed little gratitude to
his imperial master. He was suspected,—probably
with much justice—of favouring the piratical ravages
of the Danes on the Frisian coast. However, he outwardly
conformed to Christianity, and was the avowed
patron of the missionaries, though he left them to
struggle with difficulties which he might have done more
to remove. But we must make some allowance for the
situation in which he was placed. He had been for
many years—he was now—at war with other pretenders
to the throne; and as these pretenders (the sons
of Gudred) were supported by the influence of the
pagan chiefs, he had cares which he deemed more
urgent than those of religion. In 828 he was signally
defeated, and compelled to seek refuge within the bounds
of the fief which he held of the emperor. Probably
Anscar retreated with him; and subsequently returned
to his post. But the death of his coadjutor, and the
desperate state of Harald’s affairs, convinced him that
the time for the conversion of Jutland was not yet
come; and he listened to a proposal, made by some
Swedish ambassadors to the emperor, of introducing the
gospel into that country.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>According to the Swedish historians, who will not
admit that the Danes were converted before themselves,
Christianity had been embraced by many of the Goths
many years antecedent to the arrival of St. Anscar.
They assert that in 813 a church was erected at Linkoping,
through the holy zeal of Herbert, a Saxon
ecclesiastic. That the gospel was preached in Gothia
before it reached Sweden, is probable enough; but we
very much doubt whether the result was so great as the
national writers would have us believe. However this
be, St. Anscar was the first apostle of the Swiar.
Reaching Birca, the capital—a place not far distant
from the modern Stockholm—he converted some of
king Biorn’s council, and was permitted to preach
freely. This visit was auspicious; success appeared to
be inevitable; but in the midst of his labours, after a
residence of six months only, he and his companion returned
to Germany. Why? To report what had been
effected, says his biographer, Rembert, and to solicit
further aid for prosecuting the great work. But it these
objects were necessary (which we are unable to perceive),
surely <i>one</i> of them might have remained to confirm
the new converts. Anscar was the bearer of a
letter from Biorn to the emperor, written in runic characters,
and bearing testimony to the success of the two
monks.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>830 to 852.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The pope and the emperor were much gratified by the
unexpected opening in the North. To reward Anscar,
and stimulate him to greater exertions, he was made
archbishop of Hamburg, with a jurisdiction over all the
Scandinavian kingdoms, when he should have converted
them to Christianity. In addition he was invested with
the legatine authority over these regions; but it was
shared with Ebbo, who knew less of the people, of their
wants, and of their disposition, and who certainly had not
either the zeal or the prudence of the other. One of
Ebbo’s first acts was to consecrate a bishop, Gansbert,
whom he dispatched into Sweden, while Anscar sent a
vicar. It was evidently not the saint’s intention to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>return. He thought, and justly, that Denmark was a
field sufficiently wide for his own exertions, and that
he might superintend the Swedish mission from his new
metropolis. That mission slowly but surely gained
ground; while his own exertions in the more southern
portion of his immense diocese corresponded, if not with
his wishes, probably with his hopes. Both he and
Gansbert, however, had the fault of all Roman catholic
missionaries; they baptized before they had sufficiently
instructed. Hence they had the mortification to see
many of their converts join the worship of Odin and
Thor with that of Christ; and many to forsake their
new profession with as much levity as they had embraced
it. Other misfortunes arrived. Hamburg was
assailed by pirates: the sacred buildings were consumed
by fire; the same fate attended the books which the
saint had collected; and would, no doubt, have befallen
him and his clergy, had they not fled from the danger.
These pirates were headed by a king—Eric of Jutland
and Frisia. For some time the work was nearly at a stand.
Another disappointment—the loss of a monastery, which
Anscar had held with the archbishopric, and from which
the chief support of the mission was derived—paralysed
his exertions. A misfortune no less serious was the
expulsion of Gansbert from Sweden. This event is
wrapt in some obscurity. It could not be entirely
caused by religious persecution; for the king was still
tolerant. Perhaps Nithard, the companion of Gansbert,
and the nephew of Anscar, abused the popular
deities and their worshippers. There was a great
commotion; the mission-house was plundered and destroyed;
Nithard was killed; the bishop with his clergy
forced to leave the kingdom. All this, however, was
“non-jussu regis,” which the Swedish historians convert
into “Berone nesciente.” Yet Anscar did not
despair. Though poor, he contrived still to instruct
some of the Danish children, whom he designed as
missionaries for both kingdoms. Being afterwards
sent ambassador to Eric—the very prince who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>burned his cathedral, and who by Harda-Canute’s death
had become king of all Denmark—he so far softened
that monarch as to obtain permission to preach without
hinderance. At Sleswic he was allowed to build a new
church; the number of converts increased; and their
ardour was increased by the extension of their commerce
with the Christian empire. Such converts, indeed,
could do little credit to religion; still toleration was an
advantage which in time might, he hoped, effect all
that could be desired.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>852.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Unfortunate as had been the issue of the mission to
Sweden, <i>Ardgar</i>, a hermit of much sanctity, was persuaded
to renew it. He was soon joined by some
Danish converts. By Herigar, one of the chief nobles
of the country, who had sincerely embraced Christianity
at the first preaching of Anscar, they were received
with joy. Through his influence the infant worship
was again permitted at Birca; but it made little progress;
and Ardgar, whose heart yearned for his old
anchoretical life, at length resigned his missionary office,
and left the country. Still Anscar was not discouraged.
The see of Bremen being united with that of Hamburg,
offered him more ample means to prosecute his meritorious
enterprise. In the same view, he prevailed on
the German sovereign to send him ambassador to both
kingdoms. From Eric, the Danish king, he bore a
letter to Olaf<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c023'><sup>[127]</sup></a> of Sweden, containing an honourable
recommendation of his character and conduct. Eric
asserted that he had never known so good a man as the
archbishop; he had therefore allowed him to labour in
his own way for the good of the people. But on
his arrival in Sweden he found new obstacles. The
Odinic priests were seriously alarmed at the efforts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>which during above twenty years had been made to
establish Christianity in the North. The imposture to
which they had recourse affords a good illustration of
the popular character, no less than of their religious
notions. Just as Anscar and his clergy arrived at the
capital, a man suddenly appeared there, who asserted
that he was the bearer of a communication from the
gods to king Olaf and his people. The substance of
it was, that the ancient deities had conferred great
prosperity on Sweden; that hitherto they had no
reason to complain of ingratitude in their worshippers;
that now, however, there was a sad lack of zeal, their
altars being comparatively deserted for those of a new
and hostile divinity; that if the people were anxious
for another god, why go out of their own country for
one? “If,” added they, “you really wish for another,
we will readily admit your late king, Eric, to the
honours of deification!” Gross as the imposture was,
it was undisputed; the hearts of the Swedes began to
warm towards the Aser, and a temple was erected to
Eric, when altars smoked with continued sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>853 to 865.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The aspect of affairs was so unfavourable, that the
companions of the archbishop urged him to leave the
country. But he would not a second time abandon his
post. He had been successful with Eric of Denmark,
and he endeavoured to be equally so with Olaf. Inviting
that king to a feast, he redoubled his attentions,
which coming as they did not merely from an archbishop,
but from the ambassador of a powerful monarch,
were peculiarly grateful to Olaf. Yet Olaf was a limited
sovereign; though he readily promised to afford
the missionaries all the liberty he could, he was bound
to consult the will of the people, and even that of the
gods. In the true pagan spirit, he believed that other
countries might have local deities as well as Scandinavia,—deities
as powerful and as able to protect their worshippers.
He advised the archbishop to send a deputy
to the next Al-Thing, or general meeting of the freemen,
promising that he would use his influence to obtain the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>requisite licence for the celebration of the new worship.
 “Olaf first mentioned the subject to his chiefs; lots
were cast; and the gods were declared—probably
through some intrigue of the king’s—not to be unfavourable
to the preaching of Christianity. When, according
to the Germanic custom, the people were assembled
in their annual plaids, Olaf caused the subject
of the French embassy to be proclaimed by a herald.
In the discussion which followed, much murmuring was
heard; one party condemning the innovation as disrespectful
to their ancient gods; another vindicating it
as necessary to the well-being of the kingdom. A venerable
old man at length spoke:—‘King and people,
listen to me! The worship of this new god is already
known to us, and we also know that he often assists
those who call on him. This many of us have experienced
amidst the perils of the deep, as well as on
other occasions: why then should we reject what we
know to be useful? Formerly many of our people went
to Dorstadt, to embrace this advantageous faith; now,
as the passage thither is dangerous, why should we reject
a good which is brought to our own doors?’—‘We
have often found our own gods unpropitious: let
us cultivate the favour of this god, who is as willing as
he is able always to aid his servants.’ The shrewd
barbarian succeeded, because he touched in the hearts
of his hearers a chord that responded to his own.
Neither he nor they had much notion of a religion which
did not confer temporal blessings; all had been disappointed
at one time or other in their invocations for
them; all, therefore, were disposed to receive favourably
proposals from a god who promised them a constant succession
of such blessings. This was a poor foundation
on which to build; but it was better than none. A
proclamation was now made that churches might be
built, and that whoever pleased was at liberty to embrace
the faith of Christ. While these things were
passing in Sweden, a revolution in Denmark was fatal
to Eric, and, for a time, to the new religion, which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>next king prohibited. But this time was a brief one;
for the prudence of Anscar, who now returned from
Sweden, fully repaired the disaster. The ecclesiastics
whom he sent to both countries he enjoined to imitate
the example of St. Paul,—to labour for their own
maintenance, so as to be chargeable to no one. It was
probably this necessity of manual labour that rebutted
many, even more than the persecutions they endured;
for during the whole of his pontificate, he had great difficulty
in providing the infant churches with pastors.”<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c023'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>865 to 889.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The work which Anscar had so well commenced, was
as well continued by his disciple, his companion, his
friend, his biographer, <i>St. Rembert</i>, who immediately
after his death succeeded him in the archiepiscopal dignity,
with the full approbation of the pope and the
Germanic sovereign. He had, indeed, indicated to the
clergy the propriety of electing his friend, to whose merits
he had borne this splendid testimony:—“Rembert is
more fit to be archbishop than I am to be a humble
deacon.” To the success of this prelate’s labours,
ample testimony is borne by writers nearly contemporary.
He founded several churches, not in Sweden and
Denmark only, but among the Slavi. His virtues
equalled his zeal. To redeem Christian captives from
pagan thraldom, he sold the very plate of the altar.
One day, for the redemption of a virgin, he gave the
horse on which he was riding. His time was always
occupied; scarcely did he allow himself leisure for eating
or sleep. During the twenty-three years that he
presided over the united sees of Hamburg and Bremen,
he was no less zealous than he had been in company
with his predecessor. Towards the close of his life he
chose as his coadjutor <i>Adalgar</i>, a monk of New Corbey,
whom he wished to succeed him.—Of this eminent ecclesiastic,
as many miracles are recorded as he himself
had related of his predecessor, St. Anscar. That he
believed them is certain; that his biographers believed
those recorded of him, is equally so. We should have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>been glad to perceive them wrought for nobler occasions.
With all their zeal, Anscar and Rembert left few native
Christians in Sweden,—few, we mean, compared with
the population, and scarcely perhaps with the advantages
they possessed. But to them be due praise! If they
did not effect all that we could wish, probably they
effected all that they could. Their sense of responsibility
was strong enough; but their diocese was too extensive,
their duties too numerous, to allow of their
devoting as much time as they would otherwise have
done, to the Northern mission. Nor must we omit the
inveterate bigotry of some pagans, the indifference of
others, and (a still worse evil) the hardness of heart
which a vicious system of religion had engendered.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>889 to 936.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The successor of St. Rembert did not imitate the
zeal of his predecessors. To extend his authority was
apparently a dearer object than to extend religion. It
is certain that he never visited Sweden: it is probable
that he sent no missionaries to that kingdom; nor do
we read that he showed any zeal in regard to Denmark.
<i>Hoger</i>, his successor, was not more active. Of him the
canon of Bremen expressively says: “Unde fuerit, aut
qualiter vixerit, Deo cognitum est.” Yet Hoger was
half a saint; he prayed and read when he should have
slept, and still more, when he should have attended to
urgent duties. Too many have been the churchmen of
this selfish character,—esteeming every moment lost
that was not devoted to their own salvation; and expressing
only barren wishes for that of others. It is,
however, but justice both to Adalgar and Hoger to observe
that their pontificate was very brief; and that, had
their lives been prolonged, history might have left some
record of their zeal, if not of their success. <i>Unnus</i>,
the next archbishop (916–936), was of a different
character. When the invasions of the Huns and the
pagan Northmen had been repressed by his imperial
master, he proceeded to the court of Gorm, king of
Denmark, whom, however, he vainly endeavoured to dispose
in favour of the Christians. With Harald; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>son of Gorm, he was more successful. Though this
prince did not immediately embrace Christianity, he
viewed it with a favourable eye; and he protected, as
far as he could, all who professed it, especially the priests.
From Denmark he proceeded into Sweden, which had
not been visited by any Hamburg archbishop, for
above sixty years. No wonder then that, as Adam of
Bremen informs us, he found Christianity nearly extinct.
Still he did find Christians, whom he endeavoured to
establish in the faith. As Helmold asserts, whatever
might be the persecution of the Swedish kings towards
their pagan subjects, from the first dawning of
the gospel, there was never an entire cessation of
Christian worship. This excellent prelate died in the
vicinity of Birca. His best eulogium is in the words
of the canon Adam, who advises the idle, luxurious,
worldly-minded bishops of the time to follow his example:
“Look, ye bishops, who constantly remain at
home, wholly given to pomp, lucre, eating and sleep,
and who have no delight in the most urgent duties of
your post—look, I say, at this ecclesiastic, poor in
the world’s estimation, but rich in the sight of God,—one
whose end was so glorious, and who has left an
example to posterity that no disasters of the times, no
distance of place, can be an excuse for idleness.” But
what except idleness, except indifference could be expected
at a period when the popes themselves were so
worthless?</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>936 to 988.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>During the pontificate of <i>Adalrag</i>, the successor of
Unnus, Christianity made greater progress in Denmark
than it had ever yet made. This ecclesiastic was a
canon of Hildesheim; he was subsequently, we are
told, the chancellor of two, or even of three, Othos.
But this is incorrect. He was never at any time
arch-chancellor, and was vice-chancellor only during
a short period of the first Otho’s reign. Probably he
was secretary to one or more of those emperors; he
was certainly high in their favour. Through his influence,
three bishoprics were established in Jutland,—Sleswic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Rypen, and Aarhus, and one in Holstein,
that of Altenburg,—all subject to the metropolis of
Hamburg. This result, as we have before related<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c023'><sup>[129]</sup></a>,
must be attributed to the victories of Otho I., who subdued
the whole of Holstein and Jutland. Harald
would have had no peace had he not consented to reign
as Otho’s vassal for the southern part at least of Jutland;
to pay an annual tribute; to sanction the creation
of these bishoprics; to embrace Christianity with
the whole of his family; and to aid in its diffusion
throughout his dominions. If, on this occasion, he
was an unwilling convert, subsequently he became a
sincere believer in its doctrines, which he openly and
constantly professed. At the time he transferred his
government from Ledra, the ancient seat of the Odinic
superstition, to Roskild, he erected in the latter
place a church to the most Holy Trinity. It was attachment
to Christianity, even more than ambition, in
his son, that led to his tragical death. The old pagan
party were resolved to have a king of their own creed:
hence the accession of Sweyn. Though Sweyn was an
enemy of the new faith, he could not undo the work of
his father, and of the Christian missionaries: the
converts were too numerous to be exterminated. In
a few years he himself became conqueror of England,
and found it convenient to embrace the Christian faith,
which from his death was the dominant faith of
Denmark. Nor did the archbishop, Adalrag, lose sight
of Sweden, which his predecessor had done so much to
reclaim. At his instance, Liafdag, bishop of Rypen,
and a Dane, Odincar the elder, laboured in the kingdom,
and probably in some parts of Norway. Hako
the Good was at this time the ruler of the latter
kingdom, and he naturally wished to confer on his
subjects the blessings which he had received.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>988 to 1026.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><i>Libentis</i>, the successor of Adalrag, was also an honour
to his dignity. Fit missionaries were despatched
by him into both Denmark and Sweden; and if their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>progress was slow, it was steady. Their efforts were
much assisted by Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastics, who inspired
less jealousy than those of Germany, and who
had the happiness to baptize the Swedish king, Eric
<i>Arsael</i>. This monarch, it is said, was the victim of his
zeal. Not satisfied with encouraging the diffusion of
Christianity throughout his states, he laid violent hands
on the holy temple of Upsal; and for this last act fell
in a tumult of the populace (1001). On the death of
Libentis, in 1013, his successor, archbishop <i>Unver</i>,
trod in his steps. In the time of this latter prelate,
Denmark, which obeyed Canute the Great, became
decidedly Christian. The same blessing was in preparation
for Sweden. Olaf, surnamed Scot-Konung, or
the Tributary, because he sanctioned a yearly tribute to
the pope, established three bishoprics, and was enabled
to ensure a preponderance to the religion which he had
embraced. From his death, in 1026, Sweden may
therefore be regarded as a Christian state. Thus all
the three kingdoms forsook idolatry for the truth
about the same period, viz., the commencement of the
eleventh century. This revolution, as we have had
many opportunities of observing, was exceedingly progressive.
In Norway it continued during three quarters
of a century; in Denmark, from the mission of St.
Anscar to the reign of Canute the Great; in Sweden,
from the same event to the reign of Olaf Skotkonung,—in
both instances about a century and a half. Yet
we must not forget that paganism <i>lingered</i> in all three,
especially Sweden, down to the twelfth, or even the
thirteenth, century.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>On</span> the death of Sweyn, his son Canute was proclaimed
by the Danes. But this was the signal for the revolt
of the Anglo-Saxons against the Danish yoke, and for
the restoration of Ethelred. That rash and vicious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>prince was accordingly invited from the court of his
brother-in-law, Richard duke of Normandy, on the condition
of his governing better in future. What excited
his hope, and that of his people, was the abrupt departure
of Canute for Denmark. Harald, brother of the latter,
who was invested with the administration, was aiming
at the sovereignty of that kingdom; and prudence demanded
that he should not suffer the loss of his hereditary
realm, when he must evidently have again to
fight for England. Released by the death of Harald
from all apprehension in that quarter, he returned, with
all the forces he could raise, to the English coast. Lord
of Denmark, of a considerable portion of Norway<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c023'><sup>[131]</sup></a>, of
several English counties, and of a fine army in that
kingdom, he thought himself equal to any enterprise.
What most favoured his views on England was the detestation
in which Ethelred was held. His labour would have
been easy, except for the valour of Edmund Ironside,
who, but for the treason which ruled his father’s councils,
and for that father’s utter worthlessness, would
have resisted with success. Leaving to the historians
of England the task of detailing the battles and negotiations
which followed, we shall only observe that on
Ethelred’s death (1016), Edmund was acknowledged
by London and some counties; and that both parties
being tired of the destructive warfare, agreed to a compromise—the
counties north of the Thames being
ceded to the Dane, those south of the Thames to the
Saxon; and that on Edmund’s assassination (probably
at Canute’s instigation) the Danish monarch was acknowledged
by the whole kingdom. The two children
of Edmund, indeed, remained; and, if report be true,
the conqueror endeavoured to remove them by violence.
But the Swedish prince to whom they were confided,
refused to be made the instrument of his purposes, and
sent them for greater safety to the court of the Hungarian
king. In this relation there is evidently much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>romance. We have no proof that the Swedish prince
of this period was the friend, or even the ally, of
Canute. Probably the children were sent by their own
friends to a place of security.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1016 to 1028.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The English administration of Canute must be sought
in the histories of that kingdom. In Denmark he endeavoured
to give to Christianity a predominancy which
it had not yet attained. On his accession, full half of
the Danes were pagans. To reclaim them, churches
were built, and Anglo-Saxon missionaries appointed.
This latter measure was hateful to them; and it
was not agreeable to his Christian subjects, who wished
the dignities of the church for themselves. Both were
dissatisfied with his almost continued absence in England.
Availing himself of this universal feeling, Ulfo
the jarl, as we have before related<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c023'><sup>[132]</sup></a>, placed Harda-Canute,
an infant son of the king, on the Danish throne.
We have related, too, the issue of this rash step—the
resignation of the boy, and the murder of Ulfo by the
royal order. From this time there was continued tranquillity
in both Denmark and England. Canute, indeed,
was too powerful and too vindictive to be resisted
with impunity. The acquisition of a third kingdom,
which he conquered in 1028<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c023'><sup>[133]</sup></a>, surrounded his throne
with a splendour that no Saxon or Danish prince had
before possessed.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1029 to 1035.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>That Canute was sullied by many crimes is evident,
even, from his most partial historians. He put to death
many, without the forms of law, either because he
would punish their past, or avert their future, hostility.
After his accession to the English throne he
acted with great cruelty to many Anglo-Saxon nobles,
and with perfidy to more. Yet he had great qualities.
He must have been a good ruler, or he would not have
dismissed his Danish followers, with the exception of
about 3000. That he placed Danes and English on a
footing of equality; that he administered justice with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>strict impartiality; that he improved the laws no less than
the administration; that his yoke was felt to be tolerable
by the English and the Norwegians, no less than by
his hereditary subjects, are historical truths. “In fact,
he was one of the best princes that ever swayed the English
sceptre. If in his earlier days he was ferocious,
after his establishment on the English throne he was
humanised by Christianity. Of his zeal for religion, no
less than for the temporal welfare of his people, we have
evidence enough in his acts. There was an air of barbaric
grandeur about the monarch, not to be found in
any other sovereign of the times.”<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c023'><sup>[134]</sup></a> Lord of three
great kingdoms as he was, we must look for his true
elevation to his own mind; and (a rare phenomenon)
his moral qualities improved as he advanced in years.
Few are the instances, whether in history or in common
life, of men so completely reclaimed from evil to good.
Much of this reformation has been ascribed by Roman
catholic historians to his pilgrimage to Rome. They
would be more logical if they called this pilgrimage the
effect of the reformation. The state of his mind, his
motives, his principles, are well described in the
remarkable letter which he wrote from the eternal city,
and which exhibits his character in a truer light than
the comments of any historian.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c023'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>This monarch was liberal to his followers, as well as
to the church. How, considering the splendid retinue
which generally accompanied him, the magnificent presents
which he made, the churches and monasteries
which he founded and endowed, he could still be surnamed
the <i>Rich</i>, is not easy to be conceived. His
prudence was doubtless great; but his moderation is
the virtue on which his biographers dwell with most
satisfaction. There may be, and there probably is, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>truth in the well-known anecdote of his rebuking his
flatterers on the sea-coast. But another, which displays
him in a light equally striking, is less known. Many
years before his pilgrimage he drew up a code of laws,
and was one of the first to violate them by killing, in a
fit of anger, aggravated perhaps by intoxication, one of
his servants. His good sense told him that this violation
was a bad example for his ferocious nobles; and he resolved
that his punishment should be signal. Convoking
his judges, he appeared before them in the garb of a
prisoner, accused himself of homicide, and awaited their
decision. The penalty, according to the Germanic jurisprudence,
which governed the greater part of Europe,
was forty silver marks for one in the condition of the
victim.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c023'><sup>[136]</sup></a> But the slavish administrators of the law
deemed that in publicly confessing his crime, he had
made sufficient recompence. Seeing their fear of him,
he condemned himself to pay 360 silver marks, or nine
times the amount of the legal compensation. Of this
large fine half went to the kindred of the victim, half
to the crown; but the king would not touch his portion,
which was distributed to the poor.</p>

<p class='c024'>In his last testament, and near three years before his
death, this monarch divided his states between his sons.
To Harda-Canute, whom he had invested with the government
of Denmark, he left England also, because
that prince was his offspring by Emma, the widow of
Ethelred II. To Sweyn, who, since the death of St.
Olaf (1030–1035), governed Norway, he bequeathed
that kingdom. Whether any provision was made for
Harald Harefoot, the eldest of his sons, is not very
clear; but Harald taking advantage of his brother’s
residence in Denmark, usurped the English crown. He
could not expect, and he probably did not wish, that all
three should rest on the same brow. Partition was the
mania of the age.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>HARDA-CANUTE.</p>

<p class='c024'>1035–1042.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1035 to 1040.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>By his father’s death, Harda-Canute, the heir of
Denmark, was equally so of England; and he was
preparing to pass over into that kingdom when intelligence
reached him of Harald’s usurpation. But that
usurpation was not sudden, or complete; and had he
hastened with a few thousand followers to claim the
crown, he would have triumphed. But he had little
energy of character; and while he remained irresolute,
the period favourable for his hopes passed away. Fortunately
Harald’s reign was short; and in 1040 he was
called by the English themselves to ascend the throne.
On his arrival he committed an act of impotent vengeance
against the memory of his brother, whose bones
he caused to be disinterred, and cast into the Thames.
They were, however, reburied.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1040 to 1042.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>In his government of England, Harda-Canute seems
to have committed only one reprehensible act, and for
that he had provocation. A tax being levied for the
support of the Danish soldiery, was condemned by the
English, and at Worcester resisted, by the murder of
the two collectors. To vindicate his authority, he resorted
to severe measures. The ringleaders were executed,
the city pillaged and partly burnt. In other
respects he was not unpopular. His kindness to the
family of Ethelred did him great honour. To Emma
he confided a share in the administration; and to prince
Edward, the youngest son of Ethelred, afterwards
named the Confessor, whom he recalled from Normandy,
he gave a splendid establishment. As he died without
issue (the result probably of his intemperance), with
him ended the Danish dynasty in England.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1035 to 1042.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Of Harda-Canute’s government in Denmark we
have few records. He was negligent and intemperate;
and his father’s memory, more than his own qualities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>secured him on the throne. His transactions with
Norway deserve especial consideration. On the death
of Canute the Great, as we have just related, the
sceptre of that kingdom devolved on Sweyn, who had for
some years held the government. But his administration
was disliked; he and his mother were equally
unpopular; and his father had scarcely been dead a
year, when both were expelled from the country by the
ascendancy of Magnus the Good, bastard son of St.
Olaf.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c023'><sup>[137]</sup></a> Sweyn took refuge with his nearest brother
in Denmark, and died the same year (1036). If the
Danish king was feeble, he was not without ambition.
He knew that he should succeed to the English throne;
and as, after that event, he should be the sole heir of
Canute’s extensive empire, he urged his claim to the
crown of Norway. Finding Magnus too powerful for
him, he met that prince, and concluded a treaty
singular in its nature, and in its results important.
If either king died without issue, the other was to inherit
his dominions. This convention was guaranteed
by the chief nobles and prelates of the two countries.
Harda-Canute, as we have just related, did die without
issue, and the throne of Denmark accordingly fell to</p>

<p class='c024'>MAGNUS.</p>

<p class='c024'>1042–1047.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1042 to 1044.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>On the arrival of this prince in Denmark, he was
received with open arms. He was the son of a saint,
with whose miracles the North resounded; and his
own virtues (much less questionable than his father’s)
justified the expectation of a happy reign. To few
princes, indeed, can history accord more virtues than
to Magnus; yet he was not deficient in the active
duties of his station. The Jomsberg pirates who
had revolted, and whose ferocity was the dread of the
North, he speedily reduced, and their capital he laid
in ashes. This was a service both to the Danes and
the Norwegians for which they could not be too grateful.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>But the former, influenced by fickleness or by attachment
to their old line of kings, or by mortification at
receiving a sovereign from a country which they had
twice conquered, soon cast their eyes on Sweyn, son of
Jarl Ulfo and of Estrida, sister of Canute the Great.
After his father’s murder<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c023'><sup>[138]</sup></a>, this prince sought refuge
at the court of the Swedish king. As he approached
man’s estate, he grew weary of inactivity, and having
something to hope from the generosity of Magnus, he
repaired to that monarch in Norway. He did not ask
for any portion of Canute’s vast possessions: he wanted
employment merely under so generous a monarch; and
his request was immediately granted. His talents, his
lofty mien, his deportment, and, above all, his skilful
flattery, won the confidence of the Norwegian, who
made him first minister, and next his lieutenant in Denmark.
There was much imprudence in confiding to
one so ambitious and so nearly connected with the
throne a trust of this nature; but judging of other
men’s hearts by his own, Magnus thought that such a
trust would for ever bind Sweyn to his interests, and
be agreeable to the Danes. On the relics of St. Olaf
the young prince swore fidelity to the monarch, and
was well received by the people. To deepen this favourable
sentiment was his constant care; and by his
affability, his attention to his duties, and his liberalities, he
completely succeeded. When secure of their affection,
he openly revolted. Magnus assembled an armament,
proceeded to Denmark, defeated and expelled the usurper,
who again sought refuge at the Swedish court.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1044 to 1045.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>No sooner was this enemy vanquished, than another
appeared in the pagan bands, who occupied all the
eastern shores of the Baltic, that are now comprised
in the Russian monarchy. These men, scarcely less
ferocious than their allies the Jomsberg pirates, invaded
Sleswic, wasting every thing with fire and sword.
Magnus flew to oppose them, and, after a severe struggle,
triumphed. During his absence, Sweyn returned from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Sweden, reduced Scania, and passing into Zealand and
Funen was again acknowledged by the people. Victory,
in two or three successive actions, still declared for
the monarch. Yet the cause of Sweyn was not destroyed.
In the assistance of the Swedish king, in the
adventurers on all the maritime coasts of the Baltic,
and still more, in the attachment of the Danes, he had
resources which even the power of Magnus was not
wholly able to destroy.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1045.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A third enemy now appeared in Harald, surnamed
<i>Hardrade</i>, or the Stern, the son of Sigurd, and the
half-brother of St. Olaf. If there be any truth in
the ancient sagas, his adventures were most extraordinary.
He was present at the last fatal scene of
Olaf’s life; and from Norway he fled to the court
of the Russian duke Jaroslaf, whose service he entered.
With Elisif (Elizabeth), daughter of Jaroslaf, he became
deeply enamoured; but his suit being unsuccessful<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c023'><sup>[139]</sup></a>,
he repaired to Constantinople, and was admitted
amongst the Varangians, or Scythian guards of the
emperors. By his valour, and his birth, he obtained at
length the command of that formidable, though small
body, and by his exploits invested his name with much
lustre. Heading an expedition against the pirates of
the African coast, he was the victor in several battles,
and the owner of immense booty, a portion of which he
sent to his friends in Russia. He was afterwards employed
in Sicily, in Italy, and in a journey to the Holy
Land. In all this, there is no great improbability;
but what follows is too romantic to be credited. As the
reward of his services, Harald had demanded the hand
of a princess of the imperial family, and had been refused.
“Those Væringjar,” says Snorro, “who were
in Miklagard, and received rewards for their services
during the war, have said since their return home to the
North, that they were told in Greece by wise and grave
men of that country, that queen Zoe herself wished for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Harald as her husband, and that this in truth was the
cause of her resentment, and of his wishing to leave
Miklagard, though other reports were spread among the
people. For these reasons the king Constantinus Monomachus,
who ruled the empire jointly with queen Zoe,
ordered Harald to be cast into prison. On his way
thither, St. Olaf appeared to him, and promised him
protection; and on that same street, a chapel has been
since erected, which is standing at this day. Here was
Harald imprisoned with Halldór and Ulfr his <i>men</i>.
The following night there came a noble lady, with two
attendants, who let down a cord into the dungeon, and
drew up the prisoners. This lady had been before
healed by St. Olaf, the king, who revealed to her that
she should relieve his brother from captivity. This
being done, Harald immediately went to the Væringjar,
who all rose up at his approach, and received him with
joy. They seized their arms, and went to the chamber
where the king slept, and put out his eyes. The same
night, Harald went, with his companions, to the chamber
in which Maria slept, and carried her away by force.
They afterwards proceeded to the place where the gallies
of the Væringjar are kept, and, seizing two vessels,
rowed into the Bosphorus (Sævidar-sund). When they
came to the iron chains which are drawn across the
sound, Harald ordered all his men who were not employed
in rowing, to crowd to the stern with their baggage,
and when the gallies struck upon the chains, to
rush forward to the prow, so as to impel the gallies over
the chains. The galley in which Harald embarked was
carried quite over on to the other side, but the other
vessel struck upon the chains, and was lost. Some of
her crew perished in the water, but others were saved.
In this manner, Harald escaped from Miklagard, and
entered the Black Sea, where he set the virgin on shore,
with some attendants, to accompany her back to Miklagard,
requesting her to tell her cousin, queen Zoe, how
little her power could have availed to prevent his carrying
off the virgin, if he had been so minded.” The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>anxiety of Harald was occasioned by the intelligence
that his nephew Magnus had ascended the
thrones of Norway and Denmark. Proceeding through
Russia, he married the daughter of Jaroslaf; and with
her returned to Norway through Sweden.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c023'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>On reaching Sweden, where the fame of his riches
had preceded him, he entered into a league with Sweyn.
The objects of this league are not very clearly defined;
but we may infer that one of them was to
place Harald on the Norwegian, Sweyn on the Danish
throne. The wealth of Harald hired numerous adventurers;
and by the two princes the coasts of Denmark
were ravaged. Again Magnus prepared an armament
to oppose them; but his surer recourse was policy. To
detach the celebrated Varangian chief from the cause
of the Dane, he offered him half of the Norwegian
kingdom (and also no doubt the eventual succession),
on the condition of Harald’s allowing in like manner
a division of his treasure. The latter eagerly accepted
the proposal; he forsook Sweyn, repaired to Norway,
divided the treasure, the amount of which is described
as wonderfully large, and was admitted to a share in
the administration. Contrary to the usual experience
of rulers so placed in regard to each other, they lived
in harmony to the death of Magnus in the following
year. By this defection, or rather by this conversion of an
ally into an enemy, Sweyn was compelled to retire. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>he had his partisans in Denmark, and Magnus, at his
death, had the generosity to declare him his successor
in that kingdom. To Harald was left the Norwegian
throne. Thus the two adventurers became kings, in
little more than a year after the arrival of Harald in
the North.</p>

<p class='c024'>The surname of Harald <i>the Good</i>, sufficiently establishes
his character. He was indeed an admirable king
and a virtuous man. Much praise is awarded to a
code of laws which he compiled; but they no longer
exist in their original form.</p>

<p class='c024'>As with Harda-Canute had ended the ancient male
line of Denmark—a line that traced itself to Odin—Sweyn
II. may be called the founder of a new dynasty.
That dynasty occupied the throne to the extinction of
its male line in Valdemar IV., when it was succeeded
by the reigning house of Oldenburg.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1048 to 1070.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Scarcely was Sweyn invested with the dignity, when
he found an enemy as powerful as Magnus, and less
generous, in Harald Hardrade, who claimed the Danish
crown. The assertion of this claim led to many years
of warfare, ruinous to both kingdoms, but especially
to Denmark, the coasts of which were often ravaged.
In general the advantage rested with the Norwegian
monarch, who, in 1064, obtained a great victory over
the Danish fleet at the mouth of the Nissa. With
great difficulty Sweyn escaped into Zealand, and began
to collect a new armament. Fortunately the mind of
Harald was now disposed to peace. Sixteen years of
hostilities had brought him little advantage; the fortune
of war was dubious; and the Danes, like their
king, were averse from a foreign yoke. The two monarchs
met, and entered into a treaty, which left
affairs just as they had been at the death of Magnus.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>These were not the only hostilities in which they were
engaged. Both undertook predatory expeditions to the
English coast; but they could obtain no advantage
over the vigilant and intrepid monarch (William I.),
who now swayed the sceptre of that kingdom.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c023'><sup>[145]</sup></a> Sweyn
too had the mortification to see his own coasts ravaged
(those of Holstein) by the Vandalic pirates, who had
renounced Christianity, and who laid both Sleswic
and Hamburg in ashes. Before he could reach them
they retired. Subsequently he was persuaded to march
against the Saxons, then at war with the emperor; but
his troops having no inclination to exasperate a people
with whom they had long been on terms of amity, he
desisted from the undertaking.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1066 to 1070.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Sweyn showed much favour to the church. He
built many places of worship, which he endowed with
liberality; and he founded four new bishoprics: of these
two were in Scania, viz. Lund and Dalby, which were
subsequently united; and two in Jutland, viz., Wiburg
and Borglum. Yet this liberality did not preserve him
from quarrelling with it. His chief vice was incontinence.
Numerous were his mistresses, and numerous
his offspring: thirteen sons are mentioned, of whom
five succeeded him<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c023'><sup>[146]</sup></a>; but the number of his daughters
was much inferior; two only appear by history. For
this vice he could not hope to escape the censure of
holy mother, and he married. He did not, however,
marry with that mother’s consent; but chose for his
queen a Swedish princess within the prohibited degrees
of kindred. When Adalbert, archbishop of Bremen,
heard of the union, he angrily condemned it, and by
his messengers threatened the king with excommunication
if he did not separate from the princess. The
king resisted, and even threatened to lay Bremen (the
legate’s residence) in ashes; but the power of the
church was too great even for him to resist, and in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>end he dismissed his wife, who had the misfortune to
be his cousin. There is no reason to infer, with a
recent historian of Denmark<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c023'><sup>[147]</sup></a>, that he dismissed her
to recal his mistresses; for he was now arrived at
an age when the empire of the passions could not
be omnipotent. But he was probably taught to believe
that a real was less sinful than an imaginary crime—fornication
than marriage within the fourth degree.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c023'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1070.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>In another transaction we must admire, as much as
we may here condemn, the conduct of the church. Sweyn
was a man of strong passions, and of irritable temperament.
In a festival which he gave to his chief nobles
in the city of Roskild, some of the guests, heated by
wine, indulged themselves in imprudent, though perhaps
true, remarks on his conduct. The following
morning, some officious tale-bearers acquainted him
with the circumstance; and in the rage of the
moment he ordered them to be put to death, though
they were then at mass in the cathedral—that very
cathedral which had been the scene of his own father’s
murder.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c023'><sup>[149]</sup></a> When, on the day following this tragical
event, he proceeded to the church, he was met by the
bishop, who, elevating the crosier, commanded him to
retire, and not to pollute by his presence the house of
God—that house which he had already desecrated by
blood. His attendants drew their swords, but he forbade
them to exercise any degree of violence towards
a man who in the discharge of his duty defied
even kings. Retiring mournfully to his palace, he assumed
the garb of penance, wept and prayed, and
lamented his crime during three days. He then presented
himself, in the same mean apparel, before the
gates of the cathedral. The bishop was in the midst of
the service; the <i>Kyrie Eleison</i> had been chaunted, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>the <i>Gloria</i> about to commence, when he was informed
that the royal penitent was outside the gates. Leaving
the altar, he repaired to the spot, raised the suppliant
monarch, and greeted him with the kiss of peace.
Bringing him into the church, he heard his confession,
removed the excommunication, and allowed him to
join in the service. Soon afterwards, in the same
cathedral, the king made a public confession of his
crime, asked pardon alike of God and man, was
allowed to resume his royal apparel, and solemnly absolved.
But he had yet to make satisfaction to the
kindred of the deceased in conformity with the law;
and to mitigate the canonical penance, he presented one
of his domains to the church. The name of this prelate
(no unworthy rival of St. Ambrose) should be embalmed
in history. He was an Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastic,
William, whom the archbishop of Bremen had
nominated to that dignity, and who had previously
been the secretary of Canute the Great. During the
long period that he had governed the diocese of Roskild,
he had won the esteem of all men alike by his talents
and his virtues. For the latter he had the reputation
of a saint (and he deserved the distinction better than
nine-tenths of the semi-deities whose names disgrace
the calendar), and for the former, that of a wizard.
It is no disparagement to the honour of this apostolic
churchman, that he had previously been the intimate
friend of the monarch; nor any to that of Sweyn, that
after this event he honoured this bishop more than he
had done before.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1070 to 1076.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>From this time to his death, Sweyn practised with
much zeal the observances of the Roman catholic church.
By his excessive liberalities he injured his revenues;
and by his austerities, perhaps, his health. A faithful
portrait is given of him and of his people by one who
knew them well, Adam of Bremen. This ecclesiastic,
hearing so much in favour of the royal Dane, proceeded
to his court, and, like all other strangers, was graciously
received. “Sweyn,” says the canon, “is not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>liberal towards foreigners, but well versed in literature;
and he directs with much ability the missions which he
has established in Sweden, Norway, and the isles; from
his own mouth have I received most of the facts contained
in this history.” In his reign the pagans of
Bornholm were first converted to Christianity, by bishop
Egin. The image of Frigga, which they had been so
long accustomed to venerate, they demolished with contempt.
Another proof of their sincerity appeared from
their offer of their most valuable effects to the bishop.
This, unlike most churchmen of the age, he refused to
accept; and advised them to expend it in two noble
ways—in the foundation of churches, and the redemption
of Christian captives. “The king,” proceeds
Adam, “has no vice but incontinence.” The canon speaks
of Denmark as consisting almost wholly of islands.
“Of them Zealand is the largest and richest, and its inhabitants
are the most warlike. Ledra had been, but
Roskild was then, the capital. Next to Zealand in
importance was Fionia, which was very fertile, but its
coasts were exposed to the ravages of the pirates. The
capital, Odinsey, was a large city. To cross from one
island was perilous, not only from the stormy sea that
rolled between them, but from the pirates. Jutland
had a barren soil except on the banks of the rivers, the
only parts cultivated: the rest of the country consisted
of forests, marshes, and wastes, and was hardly passable.
The chief towns lay near the narrow bays on the
coast. Scania, always geographically, now politically
included in Sweden, is represented as fertile, as very
populous, and full of churches. No where, indeed, had
Denmark much lack of these structures; Fionia, Adam
assures us, had 100; Zealand, 150. “Scania is almost
an island, and separated from Gothland by large forests
and rugged mountains. Here is the city of
Lund, where the robbers of the deep laid their treasures.
These robbers paid tribute to the Danish king,
on the condition of being allowed to exercise their
vocation against the barbarians.” Among the Danes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Adam perceives many other things contrary to justice:
he sees little indeed to praise beyond the custom of selling
into slavery such women as dishonoured themselves.
So proud were the men, that they preferred death to
stripes; and they marched to the place of execution,
not only with an undaunted, but with a triumphant air.
Tears and groans they held to be unmanly; and they
mourned neither for their wives, nor for their dearest
connections.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1076.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>As Sweyn left no legitimate offspring, the only claim
that could be made was from his numerous bastards.
Harald was the eldest; but then as he was of a quiet,
gentle nature, he was not very agreeable to a fierce
people. On the other hand, Canute, the next brother,
had distinguished himself greatly in the wars against
the pagans of Livonia. There was, accordingly, a dispute
when the states assembled, most declaring for
Harald, but all Scania for Canute; and a civil war
must have been the result; but for the bribes of two
chiefs, who prevailed on the electors of that province
to confirm the choice of Harald. After this decision,
Canute refused to remain in Denmark, and passed the
rest of his brother’s life in his old occupation.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1076 to 1080.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The short reign of Harald affords no materials for
history. Silent, reserved, timid, averse to the shedding
of blood, even for judicial delinquencies, he was little
esteemed. Yet few periods were more happy than that
which witnessed his administration. He made new
laws, which have been praised and condemned. According
to Saxo, whose means of information cannot be
disputed, he abolished the judicial combat, and substituted
purgation by oath—a change which led to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>frequent perjury. But if the testimony of Elnoth be
admissible, he enacted other laws which were long valued
by the people—so valued, that they made every new
monarch swear to observe them.</p>

<p class='c024'>This prince, who had unsuccessfully contended for
the crown with his brother Harald, and who was now
unanimously elected, was very unlike his predecessor.
Fond of martial glory, he prosecuted the war in Livonia,
until he had brought it to an advantageous issue. His
next project was one of greater magnitude—to subdue
England, which the Danes had learned to regard as a
revolted province. It is, however, inconceivable how
so wild a project could enter the brain of the king, even
though the Norwegians engaged to join in its execution,
and though he received aid from his father-in-law,
Robert, count of Flanders. Perhaps he only aspired
to the recovery of Northumbria. But though a large
armament was collected, it never sailed, owing to the
intrigues of the English monarch, or the revolt of the
pagan Vandals, or probably to both causes combined.
To pacify the revolted pagans, he sent money and promises,
and detained the fleet on the Jutland coast until
the result was known. In the mean time, his warriors,
ignorant what caused his delay, began to mutiny: when
he had punished some, others vainly conspired against
his life; while the rest quietly dispersed, and he was
compelled to dismiss the Norwegians with gifts. The
armament, therefore, led to nothing but disappointment
and exasperation.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1080 to 1086.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Internally the administration of this king was distinguished
by great vigour and great love of justice.
Under the mild sway of his predecessor, and indeed for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the greater part of a century, the local governors were
so many tyrants, regardless alike of law, of religion, of
decency. Of them he made many severe examples;
he punished capitally offences which had become almost
inveterate; he applied the law of talion to all convicted
of striking or mutilating others; he completely reformed
the administration, deposing corrupt judges, and replacing
them by others of greater integrity, and we may
add of greater sternness. Pecuniary fines—the basis
of Germanic jurisprudence—were exerted with a rigour
never before experienced. In all these measures the
king was abundantly justified; but they gave not the
less offence to men hardened by long impunity. Open
mutiny or smothered discontent, loud menaces, or secret
conspiracies, marked the greater part of his short
reign. Even the rigour with which he suppressed
piracy made him enemies; if it was agreeable to the
great body of his people, it was hateful to the licentious
nobles who had so long profited by it.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1080 to 1086.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The conduct of St. Canute in regard to the church
was no less unpopular. He exempted ecclesiastics
from all dependence on the secular tribunals; he placed
bishops on the same level with dukes and princes; he
brought the clergy into his council, and endeavoured to
give them a voice in the assembly of the states. In
this policy we see little to condemn. It may be true,
in the abstract, that churchmen should be restricted to
their peculiar province, the care of souls; but practically
they have never been so; and in giving them influence
in public affairs,—in converting the bishops into
temporal barons, and the higher clergy into local
judges,—Canute acted merely in conformity with the
spirit of the times. And indeed he seems to have had
good reason for that policy. Churchmen were better
informed, more regular in their lives, than laymen: he
therefore believed that they would make better administrators
of the law; and in that belief he increased
their powers at the expense of the feudal nobles. He
could not foresee that by thus rendering them independent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>of the crown and of the people, he was preparing
a scourge for his successors.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1080 to 1086.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Though these measures raised him many enemies,
his prodigality to several churches, and still more, his
attempt to make tithes an obligatory impost, rendered
three fourths of his people disaffected to his sway. Yet
here, too, he is not to be censured by impartial posterity.
He, doubtless, saw that if the church must subsist at
all, it must not depend solely on so precarious a source
as voluntary contributions. He saw that tithes were
sanctioned by God’s word, and obligatory in the rest of
Christendom; and he thought the impost less oppressive
than any other that could be devised. But he did not
proceed to his object with sufficient caution; he was
too precipitate: he exasperated where he should have
conciliated; and he was impatient of the least contradiction
to his will. In fact, he was a despot; in most
instances a well-meaning one; but his acts were more
evident than his motives; and while he had no credit
for these, he was hated for those. In another respect
he was impolitic. Zealand he conferred, as a fief, on his
brother Eric, with the title of Jarl; Sleswic, on his
brother Olaf, with the title of Duke; and by so doing
set a precedent for the dismemberment of his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1086.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>When so many causes of dislike existed, the end of
Canute could scarcely be one of peace. He could not
carry the tithe question in the states-general; but by
his own authority he levied a capitation tax, partly as a
punishment for the resistance which had been shown to
his will, and partly for the use of the clergy. The
rigour of the collectors was no less offensive than the
tax itself. The inhabitants of Vend-syssel broke out
into open revolt, and went in search of the king, who,
with his wife, his children, and two brothers, sought
refuge in the church of St. Alban in Odinsey. There
he was soon invested; the sacred building was forced;
his attendants put to the sword, and Benedict, one of
his brothers, laid lifeless on the floor. Seeing that his
own death was inevitable, the king knelt before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>altar, and in that posture, according to one account,
received the fatal stroke. Another says that he was
killed by a lance through the window. Both agree that
he died with resignation.</p>

<p class='c024'>By the church, Canute was immediately placed in the
glorious fellowship of saints and martyrs. His claim
to this distinction is rather dubious: if he had been
a private individual, or less liberal to the clergy, if he
had exhibited greater moral virtues, and founded fewer
churches and monasteries, assuredly he would have
never been deified,—for canonization may be well
called so. His widow returned to her father’s court,
accompanied by one only of her sons, Charles. It is
not a little singular that the same destiny was reserved
for this son as for the father. Becoming count of
Flanders, he was slain by his subjects in a church, and,
like his father, “inter divos relatus.”</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1037.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The people of Jutland, proud of having killed one
king, would elect another, and in conformity with the
will of Sweyn II., which set aside the children in
favour of the brothers, they passed over the infant sons
of St. Canute, and chose Olaf, duke of Sleswic, the
third son of Sweyn. Olaf was at that time a kind of
prisoner at the court of count Robert of Flanders,
whither he had been sent by his despotic brother, on
the suspicion of complicity in the mutiny of the fleet.
But of that complaint there is no evidence. A heavy
ransom is said to have been exacted by the count,
before he was permitted to join his new subjects.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c023'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>During the reign of this prince, Denmark had one
blessing,—that of peace. But it had also one curse,—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>of famine, which the clergy declared to be a
divine infliction for the murder of the sainted martyr,
Canute. The people, we are told, died by thousands
and tens of thousands, for lack of the mere necessaries
of life; and to this cause, if Saxo be correct, is to be
attributed the tranquillity of the country. Horses and
even dogs were the ordinary nourishment of the people.
In a country where agriculture was despised, a barren
season could not fail to produce famine; our only surprise
is that the visitation was not more frequent. Prince
Olaf bore all the blame; it was his fault, not want of
foresight in his subjects, that occasioned the evil. His
personal character does not seem to have been amiable.
He is represented as avaricious, despotic, unfeeling; as
regardless of the laws and their administration; hence
tyranny in the great, and licentiousness in the people.
According to one account, he was found dead in his
bed, after an entertainment which he had given or intended
to have given to his nobles and clergy: according
to another, he died of a natural disease, regretted by
nobody. If the prayer which Saxo puts into his mouth
were really his, he does not merit the severity with
which he has been treated. Afflicted at the continuance
of the famine, he said:—“O Lord, I can no longer
endure the weight of thine hand! If thou art wroth
with my people, spare them, and let me alone suffer!”</p>

<p class='c024'>Eric was the fourth son of Sweyn II., and from the
jarldom of Jutland was raised by the states to the
throne of that kingdom. As the next harvest was one
of abundance, the people were again contented, and
he obtained credit for the abundance with the same
injustice as his brother had been condemned for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>famine. More active than his predecessor, he administered
the laws with vigour; and he destroyed Jomsberg,
the stronghold of the pirates, who had again reared
their heads during the preceding reign. To keep them
in continued subjection, he erected fortresses in their
country, and garrisoned them well.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1097 to 1103.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The most remarkable event of this monarch’s reign
is the erection of Lund into an archbishoprick. Hitherto,
Denmark had depended entirely on the archbishop
of Bremen, whose jurisdiction extended over the
whole North. The king disputed with the haughty
prelate Liemar, who then occupied the see, and by
whom he was excommunicated. Instead of submitting,
Eric appealed to Rome, and even visited that city to
plead his cause in person. He gained it and returned
triumphant to his own kingdom. Subsequently (in
1103), on his way to the Holy Land, he again visited
the Eternal City, and prevailed on the pope to invest
Lund with the metropolitan privileges. The pope
could refuse nothing to the brother of a saint, who
almost equalled that brother in devotion to the church:
besides, the immense authority held by the archbishops
of Bremen had rendered them dangerous when they had
taken, as they had usually done, the part of the German
emperors against the Roman see. By the bull issued
on this occasion, Adgar, a descendant of the famous

<p class='c024'>The cause of Eric’s pilgrimage, from which he was
destined never to return, is not well known; but it
was probably to expiate an homicidal act which he had
perpetrated in a fit of anger or of drunkenness. The
idle fable of Saxo, that while under the influence of
music he killed four of his attendants (or soldiers of his
guard), is characteristic enough of that writer, but has
obtained no credit in this country since the authors of
the Universal History adopted it. Whatever the cause,
he resolved to visit the Holy Land, and that too in
opposition to the prayers and tears of his people, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>whom he was cherished. Passing through Rome,
where, as we have just related, he obtained the erection
of Lund into a metropolitan see, he repaired to Constantinople.
By Alexis Comnenus he was received
with much distinction; though for some time he was
narrowly watched, lest, with all his piety, he should
place himself at the head of the Varangian guard, and
become troublesome to his host. His manners soon
dispelled this diffidence, and he was splendidly entertained.
Being supplied not only with provisions and
vessels, but with a liberal store of gold, he sailed for
Palestine; but, landing in the isle of Cyprus, he fell a
victim to a pestilential disease.</p>

<p class='c024'>Eric III. was one of the best princes that ever
swayed the Danish sceptre. “With his people,” says
an ancient writer, “he lived like a father with his
children; and no one left his presence dissatisfied.”
Hence his surname of <i>the Good</i>. He never undertook
any important matter without consulting his states. His
chief fault was incontinence. If, as we are assured, he
refrained from the bed of his queen, it was only to indulge
himself the more freely with his concubines, of
whom he had a considerable number. Saxo assures us
that, so far from being offended with her royal lord for
this frailty, she admitted the favoured ladies into her
own suite, and assisted to adorn them for his gratification.
Yet Eric was not far from canonization; and
but for this frailty he would probably have obtained the
honour. His liberality to the church, his pilgrimage,
his settlement of the Cistercians in his dominions, and
his foundation at Lucca of a cloister for the accommodation
of Danish palmers, procured him the epithet of
saint from more than one writer of the times.</p>

<p class='c024'>After Eric’s death there was an interregnum of two
years. He had left his son Harald governor of the realm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>during his absence; but the conduct of that prince was
so unpopular, that when the states assembled they excluded
both him and his brothers, and resolved to choose
some one of his uncles. The eldest, named Sweyn,
died before he could be elected. Ubbo, the next prince,
refused the dignity; which then descended to Nicholas,
the next in age.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1105 to 1126.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The long reign of this monarch was one of calamities,
occasioned chiefly by his jealousy of his nephew Canute,
second son of the late king. Henry king of the Obotrites,
a Slavonic people who dwelt on the Baltic coast
from Mecklenburg to Pomerania, was nearly connected
with the royal house of Denmark, his mother being
Sigritha, daughter of Sweyn II. As the Obotrites had
been subdued by at least two Danish kings, and forced
to embrace Christianity, they were regarded in the light
of vassals. But Henry, more powerful than any of his
predecessors, since he had reduced other Slavonic tribes
to his yoke, would be no vassal to Denmark, though he
was certainly one to Germany. He first demanded his
mother’s dowry, which he asserted had never been paid;
and when it was refused, invaded the southern part of
Jutland. Nicholas marched against him, and was defeated.
To arrest the career of the invader was reserved
for Canute, who had been invested by his father with
the ducal fief of Sleswic. This prince not only cleared
the duchy of its invaders, but carried the war into the
country of the Obotrites. Henry now sued for peace,
and was thenceforth the friend of his nephew. Canute
had saved Denmark from many evils; and his conduct
now showed that he was no less excellent a governor
than he had been a general. He exterminated the banditti,
restored the empire of the laws, and caused the
arts of life to flourish. His reputation gave much umbrage
to the king; nor was that feeling diminished
when, after the death of Henry, he was presented by
the emperor Lothair with the vacant regal fief. With
this augmented power he maintained tranquillity the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>more easily, not in his ducal fief only, but in the whole
of Denmark. His eldest brother Harald, whose vices
had excluded him from the throne, made many hostile
irruptions into Jutland; but Eric, his next brother, was
no less ready than he to protect that kingdom.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1126 to 1132.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The contrast between the conduct of Nicholas and of
Canute made a deep impression on the Danes. On two
of them, the king and his son, it was no less painful
than it was deep. To hasten his destruction was the
object of both. The first attempt was to accuse him of
some crime in the assembly of the states; but he defended
himself so powerfully, that he was unanimously
absolved. Disappointed in this view, Magnus requested
an interview with him, under the pretext of settling all
differences amicably; and, while unsuspicious of danger,
assassinated him. All Denmark was in instant commotion.
The kindred of the victim hastened to the
meeting of the states, and displaying his bloody garments,
called for vengeance on the murderers. To
escape the popular indignation, Magnus fled into Sweden;
but Nicholas, who relied on the support of a
party, endeavoured to brave the storm. He was, however,
solemnly deposed, and Eric, the brother of Canute,
elected in his stead. But he refused to comply
with the decree. He collected troops, and took the
field against his rival, who exhibited no less activity in
his own behalf. In the civil war which followed, the
bishops took part, and fought like the temporal nobles.
Canute had been the vassal of Lothair, and had demanded
the assistance of the empire; and that monarch
collecting a small army, marched into Jutland to co-operate
with Eric in avenging the death of Canute.
Seeing that the junction of the emperor and Eric must
be fatal to his cause, Nicholas withdrew the former
from the alliance by the offer of a large sum of money,
and by consenting to hold Denmark as a fief of the
empire. Lothair then returned, leaving the fortune of
war to decide between the two kings.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1132 to 1134.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The retreat of the Germans was the signal for renewed
and more fierce hostilities between the rivals.
With his usual perversity Harald forsook the cause of
his brother Eric, to fight for Nicholas; and Magnus,
who had powerful armies in Sweden, brought reinforcements
to the war. Success was varied: on the deep
Magnus was defeated; on the land, Eric. But some
acts of more than usual barbarity perpetrated by Nicholas
and Harald at Roskild, diminished the number
of their supporters. Still they were enabled to make
another stand on the coast near the gulf of Fodvig in
Scania. Victory declared for Eric: Magnus fell in the
battle; and Nicholas, with much difficulty, escaped into
Jutland. Among the slain were five bishops, and sixty
priests. As Magnus was dead, Nicholas declared Harald,
the brother of Eric, his successor,—a declaration which
did no good to his own cause. To escape the pursuit
of his rival, he threw himself into Sleswic, which was
better fortified than any city in the North. But this
was an imprudent act: in that city the memory of
Canute was idolized; and there he was massacred by
some members of a fraternity of which the deceased
prince had been the head. Thus fell a monarch who
in the early part of his reign had afforded his subjects
reason to hope that he would prove a blessing to the
realm, but whose subsequent conduct had covered him
with universal odium.</p>

<p class='c024'>In the reign of Eric IV., who on the death of his
rival succeeded to the government of the whole kingdom,
there is little for history. One of his first exploits
was to put to death his brother Harald, and eleven sons
of that prince. There was a twelfth, Olaf, who escaped
into Sweden, and became in the sequel king of Denmark.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>He next pursued the Vend pirates into their stronghold
of Arcona, which he took and destroyed. On his return,
he applied himself with zeal to the administration
of justice; and was assassinated by a Jutland chief,
whose father or brother he had judicially condemned to
death. This tragedy took place in the midst, not merely
of his court, but of his people, while presiding over
an assembly of the Jutland states.</p>

<p class='c024'>There were candidates for the crown,—1. Canute
the son of Magnus, and consequently grandson of
Nicholas; 2. Sweyn, a natural son of Eric IV.; 3.Valdemar,
the son of Canute king of the Obotrites, who
had been murdered by Magnus, and who in 1170 was
canonized, like the martyr of that name who had ruled
over Denmark. The bias of the assembly was evidently
in favour of Valdemar; but as both he and the
two other candidates were of tender years, the choice
fell on a grandson of Eric the Good by a daughter.</p>

<p class='c024'>The surname of this king will sufficiently explain
his character. He was indeed one of the most pacific
of men. Yet he was compelled to fight for his crown;
for Olaf, the only son of Harald that had escaped the
bloody proscriptions of Eric Emund, appeared at the
head of a considerable force, and claimed it. That if
hereditary right only was to be consulted, the claim was
a valid one, is certain, for he was the only representative
of his father, the eldest son of Eric the Good. But
the Danish throne was elective; and though the claim
was confined to one family, little regard was paid to
primogeniture. After many alternations of fortune, Olaf
was vanquished and slain (1143). But Eric himself
was conquered by the Slavonic pirates of the Baltic,
who, though so frequently humbled (if any credit is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>be placed in the national historians), soon re-appeared
in numbers formidable enough to alarm the kingdom.
This check, and the consequent decline of his reputation
in the eyes of a warlike people, induced him soon
afterwards to resign the crown, and to profess as monk
in the cloister of Odinsey.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1147.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>On the retirement of Eric the Lamb, the three
princes who had before been rejected on account of
their youth were again candidates. Valdemar being
deemed still too young, the choice was restricted to the
other two. Unfortunately for the interests of order
both were elected,—Sweyn by the Lands Thing of
Scania and Zealand, Canute by the people of Jutland.</p>

<p class='c024'>That the division of the sovereignty would inevitably
lead to civil war might have been foreseen by the blindest.
It was a long and a bloody one, which, though
suspended for a time through the efforts of the pope,
who wished all Christendom to arm against the infidels,
burst out with renewed fury. Adzer, archbishop of
Lund, led the Danish host against the pagans of the
Baltic; but the expedition was inglorious; and the
remnant which returned from it embraced one of the
two parties. The fortunes of both varied; but when
Valdemar, the favourite of the nation, joined Sweyn,
the advantage was on the side of that king, who gained
at least three battles over his rival. At one time Canute
was driven from the realm, and forced to seek shelter at
the court of the emperor Conrad III. But tranquillity
was not the result of his retirement. The Wendish
pirates, not satisfied with having defeated the archbishop,
and incited by the agitated state of the public mind,
ravaged the coasts both of Jutland and of the isles.
Finding their king and nobles unable to protect them,
the people entered into armed fraternities, which were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>consecrated by religion. They not only defended their
own coasts, but equipped vessels to cruise in the Baltic,
and to surprise such of the pagan ships as they might
find detached from the rest. In a few years twenty-two
of these vessels took above eighty of the enemy’s.
Still these were partial, isolated effects, which had little influence
over the general mass of misery. When Canute
returned as the vassal of the empire, the civil war again
raged. Frederic Barbarossa, as the lord paramount, now
interfered, and meeting the two parties, decreed that
while the title of king of Denmark should be left to
the victorious Sweyn, Canute should reign over Zealand
as a fief of the Danish crown. This award satisfied
neither party, and least of all the nation, which was
indignant with both of them for sacrificing its independence
to the emperor. Sweyn refused to cede
Zealand to his rival; and the civil war was about to
recommence, when Valdemar, to whose valour Sweyn
owed every thing, prevailed on the one to give and the
other to accept, in lieu of that island, certain domains in
Jutland and Scania. Peace therefore was procured for
the moment; but it was a hollow peace, which the
accident of an hour might break.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1152 to 1156.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The advantage which Sweyn had gained by the aid
of Valdemar he lost by his misconduct. He adopted
the German costume; imitated the German manners;
expressed much contempt for every thing Danish as in
the highest degree barbarous; seldom appeared at the
national Thing; restored the old judicial ordeal of duel;
became luxurious; and levied high contributions on
his people. A disastrous expedition into Sweden made
him despised as well as hated; and on his return into
Scania, he was assailed by the yellings of the infuriated
populace. Something worse than this result would
have been experienced by him, had not a chief, named
Tycho, one of the most influential in the province, rescued
him from his position. When at liberty, he
allowed his licentious followers to plunder the inhabitants.
Many he put to death; and among them was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>brave man who had saved him from their fury. This
atrocious ingratitude lost him the favour of Valdemar,
who passed over to the side of Canute, and cemented
the alliance by marrying the sister of that prince. It
was now the object of Sweyn to seize both princes,
either openly or by stratagem; but they were on their
guard; and each was always surrounded by armed attendants.
At length he was vanquished, and forced to
seek a temporary asylum in Saxony. But he obtained
succour from the duke of that province, and from the
archbishop of Bremen, who could never forgive the
Danes for forcing the abolition of his jurisdiction over
the North, and allied himself with the Slavonic pirates,
who were always ready to join any party that offered
them plunder. At the head of these forces he returned,
and compelled the people to receive him as their king.
Again Valdemar and Canute marched against him; but
the former, pitying the sufferings of the people, offered
his mediation, and tranquillity was for the moment reestablished.
The chief condition of this treaty was,
that the kingdom should be divided into <i>three</i> sovereignties;
that Sweyn should have Scania, Canute the isles,
and Valdemar Jutland, in addition to his duchy of Sleswic.
The whole people abandoned themselves to joy,
and Sweyn pretending to join in it, gave a magnificent
entertainment to his brother kings in the castle of Roskilda.
But at that very festival, he ordered both to be
assassinated. Canute fell; but Valdemar, who defended
himself courageously, escaped into Jutland.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1156 to 1157.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The reputation of Valdemar, and above all his words,
easily induced the people to espouse his cause. Pursued
by his active enemy, he was constrained to fight
before his preparations were completed. The result,
however, was indecisive. In a subsequent and more
general action, near Viburg, Sweyn was defeated and
compelled to flee. He was eagerly pursued by the
victors, who overtook him in a morass, from which the
weight of his armour prevented him from emerging;
and he was immediately beheaded. Never did the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Danes suffer more than under this unworthy prince.
Enfeebled at home, degraded abroad, without government
or security for either person or substance, they were
sunk even in their own estimation. But for these disasters
they could only blame themselves; they were
the inevitable results of their own folly in dividing the
monarchy.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1157 to 1169.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Never was the joy of people greater than that of the
Danes when Valdemar, whose talents had been tried on
so many occasions, succeeded to the undivided throne.
They had need of an enlightened, a patriotic, an active,
a firm governor to rescue them from anarchy at home,
and humiliation abroad. One of his most urgent objects
was to secure his coasts against the pagan rovers.
In his first expedition, however, he effected little; his
armament was inadequate to the undertaking. In the
second, he subdued most of the isle of Rugen, and obtained
great plunder. In the third, he had for his ally
Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony; and both princes
overran the maritime coasts of the Baltic, dictating
such terms as they pleased. But such expeditions had
never any permanent effect. If the pagans submitted,
or fled, scarcely was their victor beyond the confines
of their territory, than they recommenced their lawless
career. It was so with Valdemar; it had been so with
the most valiant of his predecessors. Five or six armaments
in succession had only the temporary result we
have mentioned. He saw that unless he entirely destroyed
their strongholds, cut in pieces their gods, and
converted them sincerely to Christianity, no peace was to
be expected from them. With these intentions, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>1169, he led another armament against the isle of Rugen,
and assailed Arcona. It was situated on the
northern extremity of the island, and so defended by
nature and art as to be thought impregnable. To the
inhabitants Christianity had been announced; but no
sooner were the visitors departed, than they reverted to
their idolatry, and expelled the missionaries. To their
gigantic idol, Svantovit, they offered human sacrifices,
and believed a Christian to be the most acceptable of
all. The high-priest had unbounded power over them.
He was the interpreter of the idol’s will; he was the
great augur; he prophesied; nobody but him could
approach the deity. The treasures laid at the idol’s
feet from most parts of the Slavonic world were immense.
Then there was a fine white horse, which the
high-priest only could approach; and in it the spirit of
the deity often resided. The animal was believed to
undertake immense journeys every night, while sleep
oppressed mortals. Three hundred chosen warriors
formed a guard of honour to the idol; they too brought
all which they took in war to the sanctuary. There
was a prestige connected with the temple; it was regarded
as the palladium not of the island merely, but
of Slavonic freedom; and all approach to it was carefully
guarded. Waldemar was not dismayed. He
pushed with vigour the siege of Arcona; and was about
to carry it by assault, when his two military churchmen,
Absalom bishop of Roskild, and Eskil archbishop
of Lund, advised him to spare the idolaters upon the
following conditions: that they would deliver him their
idol with all the treasure; that they would release,
without ransom, all their Christian slaves; that all would
embrace, and with constancy, the gospel of Christ;
that the lands now belonging to their priests should be
transferred to the support of Christian churches; that,
whenever required, they would serve in the armies of
the king; that they would pay him an annual tribute.
Hostages being given for the performance of these stipulations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the invaders entered the temple, and proceeded
to destroy Svantovit, under the eyes of a multitude
of pagans, who expected every moment to see a
dreadful miracle. The idol was so large, that they
could not at once hurl it to the ground, lest it should
fall on some one, and the pagans be enabled to boast of
its having revenged itself. They broke it in pieces;
and the wood was cut up into logs for the fires of the
camp. Great was the amazement of the spectators to
witness this tameness on the part of so potent a god;
and they could only account for it by inferring that
Christ was still more powerful. The temple was next
burnt; and so were three others, all with idols. The
numerous garrisons of the island were made to capitulate;
the victors returned to Denmark in triumph;
and missionaries were sent to instruct the inhabitants
in the doctrines and duties of Christianity. At the instance
of bishop Absalom, the island was annexed to
the diocese of Roskild. This was a glorious and it
was an enduring conquest; a fierce people were converted
into harmonised subjects, and piracy lost its
great support.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1169 to 1175.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>But with this vigorous effort, piracy was not extirpated:
on the contrary, the Danish coasts were themselves
ravaged the following year by the Slavonians.
This disaster was owing to the anger of Henry the Lion,
duke of Saxony, who had sent a contingent to the corps
of Valdemar. He had probably not expected the reduction
of Rugen; he certainly was jealous of his ally’s
success; and, to provoke a breach, he demanded half of
the treasures, of the captives, of the hostages, and of the
tribute stipulated to be paid. There was probably some
justice in the demand; but the king refused to comply
with it, and Henry, in great anger, informed the Slavonians
that they might consider themselves at liberty to
inflict whatever injuries they could on the Danes. How
this prince had acquired so great an ascendency over
these people; how they came to call themselves his
vassals, is one of those problems which history cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>solve. There must have been treaties, and marriages,
and conquests, which chroniclers have omitted. The
fact of his ascendency is indisputable. “He was the
only prince on earth,” says Helmold, “that could put
a bridle into the mouth of that ferocious people, and
direct it at his pleasure.” The vast restless tribes, from
Courland to Mecklenburgh, wanted only this stimulus
to rise; and they did rise, in numbers too formidable to
be resisted. Valdemar and his ministers suffered the
tide to roll on: they had the mortification to witness
its ravages on their shores; but when it had spent a
portion of its fury, they raised an armament, cleared
their shores, passed into the Baltic, and, after some advantages,
carried the war into the Vandalic territories.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c023'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
But what salutary impression could be made on a people
who, at the approach of an enemy, plunged, with their
substance, into the impenetrable recesses of their
forests, and returned the moment that enemy retired?
Jomsberg, indeed, one of the most flourishing maritime
cities in Europe, was taken, and its great treasures became
the prize of the victors; but the place had been
taken before by Canute the Great in 1010, and Magnus
the Good in 1044. No sooner was it demolished, than
it began to rise from its ruins. Valdemar therefore
perceived that, as he could not exterminate these numerous
tribes, who often acted in a general confederation,
and were always ready to descend upon his coasts,
his only hope was in the friendly interference of the
Saxon duke. He therefore met that sovereign, conceded
all his demands, and had the satisfaction to see Henry
issue his mandate, that the Danish coasts should no
longer be molested. For some years they were not; but
a very precarious surety was that which depended on
the will of another person—a person who might, at
any moment, change his policy, or whose influence might
be destroyed by death.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>The two prelates whose names we have mentioned,
Eskil and Absalom, had great influence over the king,
and over all the affairs of the realm. They were ministers
of state as well as bishops, and able generals no
less than ministers. Eskil had been educated at Hildesheim,
one of the best schools in Germany at that period.
His first preferment was a stall in the cathedral of
Lund; and he rose through the gradations of the
hierarchy to the see of Roskild, and lastly to the archbishopric
of Lund, with the primacy of the North.
The Danish kings soon found that the church had
succeeded to more than the authority of the ancient
pontiffs. Under the old system there was not a distinct
priesthood; any chief of his clan—any at least who
could trace his descent to the deified heroes of the North—could
sacrifice. But now all the offices of religion
were reserved to a body which, from its indissoluble
unity, its vast possessions, its exclusive privileges, its
favour with the pope, and its sanctity in the eyes of the
people, was nearly irresistible. Eskil, while bishop of
Roskild, contended with Eric Emund for the rights of
his church—not with spiritual arms merely, but with
the temporal sword. Being defeated, he was condemned
to pay a fine of twenty pounds of gold. This hostility
to the royal will did not prevent Eric’s successor from
procuring his elevation to the archiepiscopal throne of
Lund. In the civil wars between Eric the Lamb and
Olaf the son of Harald, he adhered to his lawful sovereign,
and was consequently expelled from his see;
but on the restoration of the royal authority, he also was
restored. In those battles between Sweyn and Canute,
the predecessor of Valdemar, he for some time fought
valiantly for the former; but, like Valdemar, he turned
to the latter, for whom he drew the sword with equal
valour. At one time he was a prisoner, but was released
through the interposition of his friends, and, above
all, through the sanctity of his character, which rendered
him amenable only to the pope. It was soon his lot
to dispute with Valdemar, on the question of the schism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>which divided the church. He declared for Alexander,
and in so doing acted in concert with the whole Christian
world, except Germany, or rather the German emperor,
Frederic Barbarossa, who espoused the cause of Victor.
Valdemar, influenced by the emperor, followed the same
party, and so did Absalom, the friend of the king. For
this adhesion Absalom was excommunicated by his metropolitan;
but, aided by the king, he resisted: recourse
was had to arms, to try which pope had the better right
to the tiara; and the result being unfortunate to Eskil,
he was compelled to retire into Sweden. At length he
sued for pardon, and obtained it, on the condition of his
returning into the royal hands some of the domains
which the prodigality of former kings had bestowed on
the church of Lund. Some time afterwards he resigned
his dignity, and retired to the monastery of Clairvaux,
in France. To that retirement he gave the preference,
from his intimacy with St. Bernard. He had founded
in Denmark five monasteries of the same order (that of
St. Benedict reformed); and, notwithstanding his martial
prowess, he was regarded by the inmates of Clairvaux
as half a saint, especially after his pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
He died in 1181.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1175 to 1179.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The successor of Eskil in the primacy was bishop
Absalom. This churchman, a native of Zealand, and
descended from one of the noblest families in Denmark,
was the most warlike prelate of the age. His
attachment to Roskild was such, that he at first
refused the dignity, notwithstanding the earnest entreaties
of the electors, and the commands of the king.
He would not separate from a people with whom he
had been so long acquainted; and to hold both sees
was contrary to the canons. When entreaties and rewards
were equally ineffectual, application was made to
the pope, who commanded him, under ecclesiastical
penalties, to assume the primacy, with the legatine
authority, and at the same time to hold the see of
Roskild. He therefore submitted, and undertook the
multitude of affairs rendered necessary by so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>posts—chief minister of state, general, admiral,
judge, bishop, archbishop, legate: how he found time
for all his duties may well surprise us. His military
talents were of a high order; and his arms were not
suffered to rust after his elevation. He had often
assisted to subdue the Wend pirates; and against them
he would now defend his flock, on the more exposed
coasts of his diocese. For this purpose he caused rude
huts to be erected on various parts of the coast; and
leaving his palace to his clergy, he resided in one or
the other of these, according to the exigencies of the
occasion. Day and night he was ready to repel any
attack of the pirates on his humble flock. Neither the
wintry storm, nor the extreme cold, could prevent him
from cruising off the coast in search of the enemy.
He was even known to leave the altar when danger
approached, and to wield the sword with an arm which
few lay nobles could equal. Thus, he was one Palm
Sunday informed that the pirates had disembarked, and
were ravaging the district. Throwing aside his mitre,
his crosier, and his pontifical vestments, he hastily assumed
his armour, summoned his household dependents,
marched to the spot, and compelled them to retire with
great loss to their ships. But if he was thus martial,
he was by no means inattentive to the duties of his station.
He was an active bishop, and a generous patron
of letters. By him Sweyn Aggesen and Saxo Grammaticus
were enabled to write their respective histories.
He paid great attention to the school which Eskil had
founded; and, in the distribution of church patronage
(and his was immense), he always gave the preference
to the men, who, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, excelled in literature.
Hence he exercised a much greater influence
than his predecessor over the destinies of the kingdom.
In the Thing his voice was always heard with
respect; he was a stout advocate for the national independence;
and his ascendency alike over the sovereign
and nobles frequently enabled him to restore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>peace when other means of reconciliation were wanting.
Nor must we omit to state, that to him the city of
Copenhagen owes its origin. In 1168 it was a mere
fishing village. The bishop erected a fortress on the
spot as a defence against the sea-rovers, and in it
placed a strong garrison. The security afforded by
the place attracted many settlers to it; it rose into
wealth and population, and by Valdemar was annexed
to the see of Roskild, to remain dependent on an authority
which had called it into existence. By the successors
of Absalom it was endowed with a municipal
charter, and its privileges confirmed by the crown.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1176 to 1179.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>There was but one circumstance to diminish the
popularity of Valdemar and his archbishop. The latter,
a strenuous advocate of all ecclesiastical privileges,
persuaded the former to enforce the collection of tithes
even by the sword. The ascendency of their characters,
and the services which both had rendered to the country,
averted mischiefs, that would have followed had any
other persons acted with equal rigour in regard to that
obnoxious impost. Both thought that resistance to this
impost was double guilt—rebellion and impiety,—and
on this belief they acted. But they had other reasons
for severity. The Scanians, who most distinguished
themselves by their hostility to the impost, were also
unfriendly to bishops, and still more to clerical celibacy.
Nor were they satisfied with remonstrances; they flew
to arms, and the archbishop was compelled to retire.
But he retired only to collect an armed force; and being
joined by the king, he returned to the province. As
both were lenient, they tried what could be effected by
negotiation. But the insurgents were impracticable:
probably they believed that both were afraid of them;
and they persisted in their rebellion, until they were
routed with great loss. Their only resource was to
throw themselves on the king’s mercy, and they were
readily pardoned. Still they refused to pay the tithes;
and as Valdemar dreaded greater evils, he prevailed on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>the archbishop to suspend the collection until the minds
of his flock were more accessible to reason.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1166 to 1177.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Long before the death of Valdemar, the states of the
kingdom, grateful for the services which he was every
day rendering to his people, at the perpetual risk of his
own life, declared his son Canute his successor. In
1177 the young prince was joined in the administration.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1180.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The transactions of Valdemar with the sovereigns of
Norway will be noticed in the chapter devoted to the
history of that kingdom. Those with the empire were
of a more complicated and not less interesting character.
It was the object of Conrad III. and of Frederic
Barbarossa, to make both him and his kingdom entirely
dependent on the empire. To the latter this object was
of greater importance, since in his perpetual disputes
with the spiritual head of Christendom he wanted all
the support that could be obtained. As little could be
effected by embassy, he had at least two interviews with
Valdemar, who was accompanied by Absalom. On
the first occasion Frederic rather forced than persuaded
him into an act of homage. There are writers who
contend that this homage was rendered only for the
conquests which the king had made on the Baltic coast,
or at most for the duchy of Sleswic. The contrary,
however, is apparent from written instruments. On
another occasion the emperor had need of Valdemar’s
aid against the duke of Saxony, Henry the Lion; and
the king conducted that aid in person. Arriving with
his fleet at Lubeck, his majestic presence won the admiration
of the German princes. From the emperor he
received many favours, and the question of homage
for the kingdom of Denmark was this time waived. We
are not told why Valdemar so readily abandoned the
Saxon duke (whose daughter was the wife of his son
Canute) for the emperor; but interest was probably the
chief motive. Flattered by the proposal of a two-fold
matrimonial alliance between his family and that of
Hohenstauffen, he left the unfortunate Henry to his fate.
These alliances, however, were not solemnised, owing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>to the youth of the parties, and still more to the heavy
sum demanded by Frederic as dowry.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1182.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>On his return to his own dominions, Valdemar was
preparing for another expedition against the Slavonians,—probably
to reduce them under his sceptre, and to
obtain the same ascendency over them as Henry the
Lion had possessed—when death surprised him in
Zealand, in the forty-eighth year of his age. Never
was monarch more lamented; he was indeed a great
and a good one. As a conqueror, and a conqueror over
savage enemies, whose humiliation was necessary to the
repose of the kingdom, he was celebrated throughout
Europe. But he was also a legislator. Three different
codes emanated from his authority:—the law of
Scania, which was founded on the ancient customs of
the inhabitants, was also amplified by new provisions,
rendered necessary by an improved state of society.
Such as were essentially pagan were rejected; others,
pagan in their origin, were easily made applicable to
Christian times. This code was published in two parts,—the
ecclesiastical and the civil—the former in 1162,
the latter in the following year. 2. The Zealand law
or code was also founded on the unwritten observances
of the inhabitants; which observances were altered,
modified, curtailed, or amplified, according to the actual
necessities of the period. They were published in 1171,
and were also divided into two portions—the civil
and the ecclesiastical. These codes, with the addition
of the Jutland law, which was added by Valdemar II.
form the basis of the present law of Denmark.
From the reign of this able monarch, the rights of all
classes in the community were more clearly defined.
But those of the agricultural class were not improved
by the change of circumstances. Prior to Valdemar’s
reign even the peasants attended the provincial Thing
in arms. They exercised the right of suffrage which
they had derived from their pagan ancestors, with as
much freedom as the noble. But when feudality
made such progress in the kingdom; when compelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>to exchange their allodial for vassalitic lands, and to
march at the bidding of their temporal or ecclesiastical
chief, they lost their noble independence. Yet
from evil comes good. Many of them had been unruly
subjects; if unable to carry any thing by clamour,
they had used their arms with better effect, and through
their numerical superiority, they had too often prevailed
on the calm wisdom of the old chiefs. Now they
were no longer allowed to appear in arms, and the
change was a blessing.</p>

    <div>CANUTE VI.</div>
    <div class='c000'>1182–1202.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1182.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>This prince had been crowned in his father’s lifetime
and from his fourteenth year had been admitted
to a share in the government. His accession therefore
to the undivided sovereignty was expected to pass without
opposition. But the people of Scania elected another
sovereign—Harald, a grandson of prince Magnus.
The contest, however, was short lived; they were reduced,
and their ruler compelled to flee into Sweden.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1182 to 1189.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The reign of this monarch was one of conquest and
of prosperity. Soon after his accession, Absalom the
archbishop led an armament against Bogislas duke of
Pomerania, who exhibited ill-will to Denmark and her
vassals, and obtained a complete victory over the enemy.
During the two following years the warlike operations
continued, and Bogislas at length was compelled to
throw himself on the royal mercy. Besides offering a
large quantity of gold, he did homage for all his possessions
to Canute. The two dukes of Mecklenburgh were
also reduced, and acknowledged fealty to him. The
submission of two such provinces, which had been dependent
on Henry the Lion, and had subsequently
acknowledged the superiority of the empire, filled the
king with so much pleasure, that he assumed the title
of king of the Vandals. To this title he had, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>opinion, a two-fold claim: first, in virtue of the investiture
of his ancestor, Canute duke of Sleswic, with
the royal fief of the Obotrites<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c023'><sup>[152]</sup></a>; and, secondly, in
virtue of his present conquests.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1183 to 1188.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>To assume the feudal supremacy over these regions
was a blow struck at the authority of the emperor
Frederic Barbarossa. Between these potentates there
was a misunderstanding from the very commencement
of Canute’s reign. Frederic invited him to his court
under the pretext of drawing more closely the amicable
bonds which had been formed between him and
Valdemar; but as the king suspected that this was
only a lure to enforce the payment of homage, he evaded
compliance. It soon appeared that such was indeed
the intention; for he was formally summoned to visit
the diet for that purpose. A second refusal to attend
so exasperated Frederic that he threatened to confer
the fief of Denmark on some other vassal. The king
replied, that before he could give it, he must first take
it. All negotiation being useless, the emperor offered the
greatest insult to the majesty of Denmark, by sending
back to her own country the sister of Canute, who had
been betrothed to his second son, the duke of Swabia.
From this moment the breach was irreparable; and the
king turned with more zeal to the cause of his father-in-law
Henry the Lion.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1191 to 1202.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The next three years were years of tranquillity for
the realm; but its peace was now disturbed by a
bishop and a member of the royal family. Valdemar,
a bastard son of Canute V., held the see of Sleswic.
In addition, the king had conferred on him the government
of the duchy until Valdemar, the king’s brother,
for whom the fief was destined, reached an age fit to
govern. When that age arrived, the prince was knighted,
and at the same time invested with the duchy, of which
he hastened to take possession. The bishop had tasted
the sweets of power, and he was deeply hurt at its withdrawal:
from that moment he became the enemy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the king. Determined on revenge, he entered into alliance
with all whom he knew to be hostile to Canute;
and, among others, with Adolf of Schawenburg, count of
Holstein. When his preparations were matured, he
threw off the mask, declaring that his right to the Danish
throne was as good as the king’s, and demanding a share
of the sovereignty. Passing into Norway, which at
that time was not on friendly terms with Denmark, he
obtained supplies, returned to the latter kingdom, and
assumed the royal title. At the same period another
army, led by the count of Holstein, marched towards
the Eyder to support his views. To Canute it was
evident that their operations could not be long sustained;
that the invaders would soon be in want of provisions,
and disperse of themselves. Instead therefore of risking
an action, he quietly watched the motions of the
bishop. The result justified his policy; the treasures
of Valdemar were speedily exhausted; his mercenaries
disappeared; he threw himself on the royal mercy;
but was conducted a close prisoner to a strong fortress
in Zealand (1194). Adolf yet remained; the king
marched against him, and forced him to sue for peace.
But that peace was of short duration. The count
being required to do homage to Canute for some of the
domains which he had obtained by the deposition of
Henry the Lion, refused to acknowledge any other
superior than the emperor; and to fortify himself against
the vengeance of the king, he entered into an alliance
with the margrave of Brandenburg, whose territory
adjoined the Vandalic dominions of the Dane, and who
had an interest in preventing any further augmentation
in that quarter. To assail both, Canute sent an armament
to the northern coast of the Baltic; and as the
venerable Absalom was now too old and too infirm for
active warfare, the bishop of Roskild was invested with
the command. The result was not very favourable to
the king. Two years afterwards, however, he took the
field in person, and forced Adolf to accept terms of
peace: the chief were, that Dithmarsh, with the strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>fortress of Ratzburg, should be ceded to Denmark
(1200). But in this, as on the former occasion, tranquillity
was of short duration. Adolf again quarrelled
with his ally; and Valdemar, the king’s brother, invaded
Holstein. The result was favourable to the Danish
arms: Adolf, who had thrown himself into Hamburg,
was compelled to leave it, and to witness the fall of
Lubeck, which was feudally subject to him. Most of
Holstein was now reduced; and the duke having, in the
king’s name, received the homage of the towns and
nobles, returned to Sleswic. No sooner had he left the
province, than the count re-appeared; but it was only
to be made prisoner, and conveyed in triumph to one
of the Danish fortresses. The king himself soon appeared
amidst his new subjects; and at Lubeck he received
the homage of the great vassals of Holstein,
Dithmarsh, Stormar, Ratzburg, Schwerin, and other
lordships, which were now subject to him, but which
he could not incorporate with the monarchy, because
they were dependencies of the empire, and for them he
must himself do homage to the chief of that empire.
This was a proud day for Denmark; but that pride was
much alloyed by the sudden death of Canute, in the
very flower of his age.</p>

<p class='c024'>The flourishing state of Denmark under this prince
is well described by Arnold of Lubeck. He alludes to
its vast commerce, to its ceaseless activity, to its constantly
increasing wealth, to its improvements in the
arts of life, to its military reputation, to its zeal for
learning. Many Danish youths, he informs us, were
annually sent to study at Paris, where they distinguished
themselves in philosophy, law, and theology. Many
became admirable canonists; many subtle didacticians.
The visits of young Danes to the capital of France may
be explained by the union of Ingeberg, sister of Canute,
with Philip Augustus. That union indeed was for many
years an unhappy one; she was dismissed to make way
for a concubine; until the monarch was compelled by
the pope to receive her back to his palace.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1201.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Towards the close of Canute’s reign died archbishop
Absalom, who had held the see of Roskild since 1158,
and the primacy since 1178.</p>

<p class='c024'><a id='Valdemar'></a>As Canute VI. died without heirs male, the choice
of the states fell on his brother Valdemar, duke of
Sleswic, who, as we have just related, had given some

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1203, 1204.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Like his predecessor, the new king repaired to Lubeck
to receive the homage of the conquered inhabitants;
and there he assumed the titles, “King of the Slavonians,”
and “Lord of Nordalbingia.” In the midst
of his triumph he offered to release count Adolf, provided
the latter would for ever renounce all pretension
to Holstein with his other domains north of the
Elbe, and engage not to make war, either personally, or
through his allies, on the king of Denmark. The conditions
were accepted; and hostages being given for
their execution, the count was enlarged. Imprisonment
seemed to have sobered him; for he passed the rest of
his days in tranquillity.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1204 to 1210.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Having fomented the troubles of Norway in revenge
for the aid given to bishop Valdemar, and exacted an
annual tribute from Erling, whom he had opposed to
Guthrum<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c023'><sup>[153]</sup></a>, the Danish king departed on a more distant
expedition,—against the pagans of Livonia. It was attended,
however, with no great success: the best that
can be said of it is, that it was not disastrous. A subsequent
expedition into Sweden was more unfortunate:
he was signally defeated; but peace was made on terms
sufficiently honourable. About the same time the national
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>arms regained their former lustre by the conquest
of Eastern Pomerania, the duke of which did homage
to Valdemar.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1205 to 1218.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>From the prison to which he had been consigned by
Canute VI. the bishop of Sleswic was no inattentive
spectator of events. He longed for revenge; but he must
first recover his liberty. In this view he applied to the
pope, to the archbishop of Lund, to many prelates of Denmark,
and even to the queen, and interested them so far in
his behalf, that Valdemar, at their intercession, agreed to
release him, on the condition of his never again entering
Denmark, or any other place where he might give umbrage
to the state. Of these conditions the pope was a
guarantee, and he repaired to Bologna; but that city he
soon left to urge his interests with the chapter of Bremen,
some members of which showed a disposition to elect
him. The king immediately complained to Innocent III.
that Bremen was, of all cities, that where the bishop, if
elected, would be most likely to injure him; and the
pope, admitting the justice of the plea, commanded the
prelate to desist from aspiring to the vacant dignity.
That command he disregarded. Philip of Swabia, now
head of the empire, was hostile to the Danish king: from
him the bishop readily obtained troops, and with them
hastened to Bremen, where he was soon elected. But
Burkard, the other candidate, being favoured by the
chapter of Hamburg, which had a voice in the election
equal to that of Bremen, also assumed the archiepiscopal
dignity, and obtained troops from the Danish king.
What confirmed the triumph of the latter was the suspension
of bishop Valdemar by the pope, and the death
of his patron Philip. Otho, the new emperor, concurred
with the pope and with Valdemar in expelling the
bishop from Bremen. But on the death of Burkard,
bishop Valdemar was introduced to the see, with the
full concurrence of the emperor. In revenge, the
Danish king espoused the interests of Frederic II. king
of Naples, in opposition to those of Otho. For this
service the grateful Frederic ceded to the Danish crown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the conquests which Valdemar and his predecessor,
Canute VI., had made in the empire and in Slavonia.
But the letters-patent containing this cession (dated
from Metz in 1214) could have no validity, since Otho
was yet obeyed by a considerable portion of the empire.
Still the cession was a triumph. Not less so was the
excommunication of Otho and of archbishop Valdemar
by the pope. The first soon died; the latter, succeeded
by the bishop of Osnaburg, retired to a monastery, and
was for ever dead to the world.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1219 to 1223.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Freed from the cares which had so long distracted
him, the king again turned his eyes towards Livonia.
His former successes in that region had not corresponded
with his preparations: the bishop of Riga was persecuted
alike by the pagan inhabitants and the Greek Christians:
the glory of vindicating the true faith was no slight one
in his estimation; but the ambition of reigning over
the whole maritime coast of the Baltic, from Holstein
to Livonia, was a still greater inducement for undertaking
a new expedition. Never had Denmark equipped
so great an armament as that which now left her ports.
The Esthonians, against whom his attacks were chiefly
directed, prepared to receive him, but they were defeated;
a new city, Revel, was built, to awe the province; and a
Christian bishop made it his metropolis. The advantages
resulting from this conquest were almost neutralised by
the hostility of the bishop of Riga, who regarded his new
brother as an intruder on his own domain. He claimed
the greater part of Esthonia as a part of his jurisdiction,
and he sent his missionaries through it to reclaim
it from idolatry. On the other hand, the archbishop of
Lund, in behalf of his royal master, prohibited those
missionaries from labouring in their vocation, and sent
those of his own country and his own church to oppose
them. It will scarcely be credited by modern
readers—though the fact seems indisputable—that
the Danes actually hung an Esthonian prince for no
other crime than that he had received baptism at the
hands of the bishop of Riga’s dependents. What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>were the motives—shrewd though pagan—to infer
from this and similar facts other than this—that the
god of the Danes was not the god of the Germans?
The pope and the emperor declared for the Danish
king, in opposition to the complaints, the remonstrances,
of the bishop. At length Valdemar, of his own accord,
abated much of his pretensions, and allowed a portion
of the disputed territory to be ceded to the bishop, and
to the Christian knights whom that bishop had taken
into his service.</p>

<p class='c024'>At this period Denmark was at the summit of her
glory. Her descent was more rapid than her rise.
There are few instances in all history where that descent
is so remarkable. The occasion of this change was a
man insignificant in himself, and in his influence.
Among the vassals whom Valdemar had acquired by his
successes over the count of Holstein, was Henry count
of Schwerin. In granting to Henry the investiture of
the lordship, Valdemar had demanded the hand of the
count’s sister for his natural son Nicholas, whom he
had created count of Upper Halland, and, as a dowry,
one half of the castle of Schwerin with the dependencies.
Whether this stipulation was sanctioned by the
count, we know not; but we know that Valdemar had
forcibly occupied a portion of the lordship, and conferred
it on that son. This was an injustice, and
deeply was it revenged. Count Henry repaired to the
Danish court, showed great obsequiousness, won the
confidence of the king, and one night while encamped
in the wood after a hard day’s hunting, he caused both
Valdemar and his eldest son to be surprised, carried on
board a vessel, conveyed to the Mecklenburg coast, and
confined in the strong castle of Schwerin! All Europe
was in surprise at an event which resembled a tale of
knight errantry more than a fact—that the obscure, the
powerless count Henry should thus seize the greatest
monarch of the North, and cast him like a common
felon into a dungeon.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1223 to 1226.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>That all Denmark did not rise as one man, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>hasten to release its monarch, may, to modern readers,
seem extraordinary. But had it done so, we know not
what the result might have been. If those were days
of chivalry, they were also days of gross perfidy: as
an army approached Schwerin, he would have been
transferred to some more distant fortress until he had
acceded to all the terms demanded from him. Many
were the princely nobles who were ready to share in
the responsibility of the act, provided they might also
share in its advantages; even the emperor Frederic was
inclined to imitate the example of his predecessor in
regard to Richard Plantagenet. More ruinous to Denmark
was the captivity of Valdemar, than that of
Richard to England. We shall not detail the negotiations
which, during three years, agitated the realm;
but the reverses experienced by the Danish arms may
be noticed. The new conquests north of the Elbe
were lost. Livonia and Esthonia were freed from dependence
on the crown. The Slavonic provinces of
Pomerania asserted their independence. Lubeck and
also Dithmarsh showed a disposition to escape from the
yoke. At length the menaces of the pope, and still
more the gifts distributed among the leading actors
in this strange proceeding, led to the monarch’s release.
The conditions were that 45,000 marks of
fine silver should be paid for his ransom, with all the
gold and ornaments which the queen possessed, and
complete habiliments for 100 knights; that forty Danes,
including two sons of the king, should remain as hostages;
that all the domains between the Elbe and the
Eyder should be ceded to the empire; that all the Slavonic
conquests should be renounced except the isle of
Rugen; that Valdemar should swear never to attempt
the reconquest of the territories now abandoned.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1226 to 1238.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>On his return to his own states, Valdemar applied to
the pope to be released from the oath he had taken,
and for the restoration of his hostages; promising that
if the application were successful, he would join the
crusade. In vain did the pope interfere; beyond the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>release from his oath, he obtained no advantage. There
were too many interested in the cause of count Henry
to leave him thus exposed to regal or papal vengeance.
Adolf of Schawenburg, Albert duke of Saxony, the archbishop
of Bremen, the prince of Werle—all had profited
by the spoil, and all had troops ready to defend
their usurpations. In great wrath Valdemar took the
field; but his good fortune had left him for ever; and
after many fruitless, however ruinous, efforts, he was
compelled to make peace with his enemies, and to pay
money for the ransom of his hostages. The loss of Lubeck
and of all Dithmarsh grieved him more perhaps
than the rest; for Lubeck was already a rich and a
populous city, the centre of a large commerce. Equally
fruitless were his endeavours to recover the Slavonic
provinces. They were in the power of the bishop of
Riga, and of the Teutonic knights, who could always
depend on the favour of the pope and that of the emperor.
Revel and a small district of Livonia were at
length restored to him.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1238 to 1241.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>During the rest of his life, Valdemar applied himself
to the internal administration. He caused a survey to
be made of the whole kingdom; and of this important
document the greater part still remains. There were
eight bishoprics, subdivided into parishes, and into
Styreshavne or maritime districts, each district to furnish
a certain number of men, and each see a certain number
of ships, whenever required by the public service.
North Jutland had four of these sees—Rypen, Aarhus,
Viborg, Borglum, which together supplied 450
vessels. South Jutland, or Sleswic, one see, was divided
into 130 of these districts, each to furnish a vessel.
Fionia, Laland, and Langeland, forming the diocese of
Odinsey, were rated at 100. Zealand, Moen, Falster,
and Rugen, which formed the see of Roskild, were
rated at 120; Scania, Holland, and Bleking, subject to
the archbishop of Lund, contributed 150.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1240.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>As a legislator, Valdemar ranks high in the Danish
annals. In 1240, he promulgated what is termed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Jutland law<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c023'><sup>[154]</sup></a>, but which he intended for the whole kingdom.
The attachment, however, of the Scanias and
Zealands to their unwritten customs, inclined them to
receive this code as supplementary only. To it we shall
revert in the chapter appropriated to northern jurisprudence.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1241.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The late king had associated with him in the government
his eldest son, by the title of Valdemar III., and
when that prince was killed in hunting (1231), Eric,
duke of Sleswic, the next son, supplied his room.
Eric therefore had been crowned, and had an active
share in the government, ten years before the death of
his father. At the time he was thus associated in the
regal power, he had relinquished the duchy of Sleswic
in favour of his next brother, Abel, while Christopher
and other brothers had extensive domains conferred on
them in different parts of the kingdom. Nothing could
be more unwise than such feudal concessions: they
were sure to engender quarrels, and eventually civil
wars.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1241 to 1248.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Scarcely was Eric on the throne, when he had a
deadly quarrel with Abel, duke of Sleswic, his next
brother. He wished to recover some of the territories
which his father had been forced to cede, especially
Holstein: Abel, who was the guardian of the count
of Holstein’s children, resisted, on the specious plea
that he was bound to defend their interests; but his
real motive, as we shall soon perceive, was a very different
one. The two brothers flew to arms; but an apparent
reconciliation was effected between them through
the interference of German and Danish friends: Abel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>resigned the tutorship, and ceased therefore to be responsible
for the result. But he evidently nursed a
vindictive feeling towards Eric, and he could not long
refrain from exhibiting it. He refused to do homage
for Holstein, which he determined to hold in full
sovereignty. Again was the sword drawn; and though
returned for a time to the scabbard, the feeling of hatred
rankled in the duke’s heart. During this short suspension
of hostilities, Eric endeavoured to regain Lubeck,
and he sent an armament into the river Trave; but a
fleet from Sweden, which had a great interest in the
protection of that city, compelled him to raise the siege.
The coasts of his kingdom were now ravaged by the
combined Swedes and citizens; and at the same time,
through the influence of his perverse brother, the count
of Holstein and the archbishop of Bremen became his
open enemies. Allured by the successful example of
Abel, the other brothers also refused to do homage.
Seeing that the very existence of the monarchy was
at stake, he took the field. Numerous as were his
enemies, he created more, and those more formidable
than the rest,—his own bishops, who naturally threw
themselves into the party of Abel. The ravages committed
in the fraternal war were dreadful. At length
the city of Sleswic being taken by surprise, Abel fled
to his allies; and when he could effect nothing by arms,
he had recourse to stratagem. He received with eagerness
the proposals of a pacification from the duke of
Saxony and the margrave of Brandenburg, who were
connected with the regal family of Denmark. The brothers
met, swore friendship, and separated.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1249.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Freed from that dreadful scourge, civil war, Eric now
projected an expedition into Livonia, to recover the
territories which his father had ceded. To defray the
expenses, a tax of a silver penny was laid on every
plough in the kingdom. With much difficulty he obtained
the sanction of the states to this impost; with
more difficulty still was it collected, at least in Scania.
The inhabitants of that province were fond of rebellion:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>they rebelled on the present occasion; but as usual they
were subdued, punished, and made to contribute like
the rest of the Danes. The expedition arrived in
Esthonia, but its details are very imperfectly recorded in
the national chronicles. They merely tell us that the
Teutonic knights acknowledged the king’s right to what
he held, and to what he might hereafter conquer from
the pagans. Certainly he made no conquests; and probably
his troops were defeated by St. Alexander Neusky,
governor of Novogrod.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c023'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1250.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Eric, on his return, engaged in war with the count
of Holstein, who, conjointly, with the archbishop of
Bremen and the bishop of Paderborn, laid siege to
Rendsburg. To relieve it, the king advanced at the
head of a considerable force. But his doom was at hand.
Near Sleswic he was met by Abel, who treated him with
the utmost deference, with the most obsequious respect;
and so disarmed him, that in the joy of his heart he
accepted an invitation to one of the duke’s country
palaces, in the immediate vicinity of Sleswic. From
that palace he was forcibly dragged on board a boat in
the Sley, taken to a solitary part of that river, landed,
allowed to make his confession, and beheaded. Heavy
chains were then fastened to his corpse, and it was
thrown into the deepest part of the river. The news
was spread that he had perished by accident in the
river; but the monks who had administered to him the
last offices of religion, declared that he had been murdered,—by
whose contrivance was unknown. The body
being afterwards found by some fishermen, confirmed
that declaration. It was buried in the church of the
monastery. The brethren even asserted that miracles
were wrought at his tomb, and they were believed:
some years after his death he was canonized; and he is
the fifth Danish prince who has been thus deified.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1250 to 1252.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>To obtain the reward of this fratricide, Abel sent his
creatures to the assembly of the states, convoked for the
election of a new king. As there was only suspicion,
he was permitted to purge himself by his own oath, and
by the oath of twenty-four nobles, that he was innocent
of the deed. How he could find that number of men
to take such an oath, may surprise us; but we must
remember that the tenor of it was that “to the best of
their belief” the accused party was not guilty of the
crime. He was therefore elected and crowned by the
archbishop. By lavish gifts to the clergy, and to the
nobles who adhered to him, and by confirming his brethren
(from whom he had the most to fear) in their
respective fiefs, he stifled all murmurs. To avert
war, too, which he well knew would lead to his ruin,
he surrendered to the count of Holstein the domains
which his brother had occupied, and to the
Teutonic knights most of what he yet held in Livonia.
These concessions did no harm to Denmark; and some
of his other measures were decidedly good. He restored
the wisest parts of the Danish constitution,
especially the annual meeting of the states; he improved
the laws; and began to redeem the crown
lands, which during the late reigns had been pledged.
In short, like all usurpers, he sacrificed to popularity,
and succeeded so well that he was enabled to raise an
extraordinary impost to complete his work of redemption.
In the western parts of Sleswic, however, the
collectors met with opposition, and Abel, to punish
the disobedience, marched with a body of troops. He
penetrated into a country always marshy, and now rendered
more so by the rains. Surprised by a strong party
of the inhabitants, he fled, and fell into a morass, from
which the weight of his armour prevented him from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>emerging. In this helpless situation he was discovered
and slain.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1252.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The mutilated corpse of Abel was left in the marsh,
where it remained for some time, and, if tradition be
true, to the great annoyance of the whole country.
Abel was too great a sinner to lie peacefully in his grave.
He became a wandering spirit. Supernatural voices had
so terrified the people that they were glad to deliver
the corpse to the canons of Bremen, who honoured it
with the rites of sepulture. But they too had soon
reason to regret the contiguity of the vampire: he was
frequently seen out of his tomb; and at length the
corpse was disinterred, and buried in a solitary marsh
a few leagues from Gottorp. Still there was no respite;
and the inhabitants nearest to the place removed to a
distance. To this day the superstition has been perpetuated
that the murderer on a dingy horse may sometimes
be seen, followed by demon hounds, amidst the echoing
of the magic horn. Leaving these wild fancies to vulgar
admiration, the Christian will scarcely fail to acknowledge
that in the death of Abel there was retribution.</p>

<p class='c024'>Abel left three sons, the eldest of whom, Valdemar,
was designed for his successor; but the young prince,
returning from the university of Paris, was seized by
the archbishop of Cologne, and detained in prison until
a ransom of 6000 silver marks was paid. Probably
this act was done at the instigation of Christopher,
brother of the late king, who knew that he alone was
to be dreaded, since he had been already recognised by
the states, and his brothers were too young for the duties
of government. Besides, the dislike to Abel’s posterity
was general; and Christopher might well aspire
to a throne which, after their exclusion, became his of
right. Nor was he disappointed: by the states he was
immediately elected.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>CHRISTOPHER I.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1252 to 1258.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The reign of this prince was even more troubled than
that of his predecessors. Fearing a popular re-action
in favour of Abel’s sons, who were minors, he claimed
the guardianship. The claim was resisted by the house
of Holstein; and to decide the contest both parties resorted
to arms. The king was defeated; and though he
soon collected a larger force, he found the number of
his enemies increased. The people of Lubeck, always
hostile to Denmark, and for that same reason always the
allies of the counts of Holstein, ravaged the coasts, while
those nobles reduced Sleswic. The two margraves of
Brandenburg also complained that one of them had
not received the dowry promised with his wife, Sophia,
daughter of Valdemar II.; and they joined the common
league. Nor was this all: during Abel’s reign, there
had been some disputes with Sweden and Denmark;
and to allay them a conference had been covenanted between
the three kings. The death of Abel had prevented
the pacification; and Christopher, engrossed by other
troubles, was unable to give them the satisfaction required.
In revenge the Norwegian arrived with a great
armament, while 5000 Swedes penetrated into the heart
of the country. Never had the situation of Denmark
appeared so critical; but strange to say, its safety lay
in the number of its enemies, who became jealous of
each other, and of the advantages which each might
secure. In this disposition, the offer of mediators was
accepted; and conditions of peace between Christopher
and his nephews were at length sanctioned. He agreed
to invest those nephews, on their reaching majority, with
the duchy of Sleswic; and they, in return, were to
renounce all pretensions to the crown. In conformity
with this treaty, Valdemar, the eldest son of Abel, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>released from prison at Cologne, and invested with the
government of the duchy. The margrave of Brandenburg
was appeased by the pledge of two fortresses, until
the dowry could be paid. Thus there remained only
Norway and Sweden to be pacified; and though hostilities
existed for some time, they were desultory, and
were terminated by a reconciliation. An interview
with Birger, regent of Sweden, easily led to that result;
and when Hako of Norway, who had again arrived
with a formidable armament, saw that Christopher
was sincerely desirous to satisfy him, he now accepted
the will for the deed, and became the friend of the monarch.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1256, 1257.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>But the chief troubles of Christopher arose from his
own prelates. Jacob Erlandsen, bishop of Roskild, a
personal friend of Innocent IV., had imbibed the highest
notions of clerical privileges. He condemned the influence
of the crown in the election of bishops, which was
certainly an evil, since royal favourites only were appointed
to the rich sees. Acting on his own principle,
that bishops had no earthly superior except the pope,
he refused, when elected by the chapter of Lund to the
primacy, either to allow royal influence any weight in
the election, or to accept of confirmation at the royal
hands. He next condemned some of the provisions in
the ecclesiastical law which Valdemar I. had promulgated
in Scania; and when opposed by the king, he intrigued
with the royal enemies. There can be no doubt
that in his resistance to the encroachments of the crown,
not merely on the freedom of election, but on the ecclesiastical
revenues, he was abundantly justified; but
the <i>manner</i> of his resistance was censurable; and still
more so was his league with the enemies of the king.
If the primate was an archbishop, he was also a temporal
baron; nothing was more easy than to confound the
two characters; and while Christopher determined to
punish him in the latter, he chose to forget the privileges
of the former. Erlandsen was summoned before
the states at Vyburg. In reply he convoked a national
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>council to be held at Vedel, a town in the diocese of
Rypen in Jutland. In that assembly it was decreed
that if any Danish bishop were taken and mutilated, or
afflicted with any other atrocious injury, by the order,
or with the connivance of the king, or any noble, the
kingdom should be laid under an interdict, and the
divine service suspended. If the same violence were
committed by any foreign prince or noble, and there
were reason to infer that it was done at the instigation
of the king or any of his council, in the diocese of that
bishop there should be a “cessatio à divinis,” and the
king during a month should be bound to see justice
done: if he refused, the interdict was to be extended
over the whole kingdom. After it was laid, no ecclesiastic,
under pain of excommunication, was to celebrate
any office of religion in the royal presence. The decree
was sent to Rome, and confirmed by pope Alexander in
October, 1257.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1257.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The wrath of the king and of his nobles was roused
by this bold, though perhaps necessary, act. But the
primate was of an intrepid temper, and quite prepared
to share, if necessary, the fate of our Thomas à Becket.
In the next diet a number of frivolous and two or three
substantial charges were made against him; and he
begged time until the next meeting of the states to prepare
his answers. In the interim efforts were made to
reconcile the two; and they sometimes met. But Erlandsen,
by excommunicating a lady of Scania, a favourite
of the king, again rekindled the half-smothered
wrath of Christopher. Repairing to Lund, the latter
held his tribunal, invited all who had any complaint
against the archbishop to appear before him, and summoned
the archbishop himself to appear and answer
whatever might be urged against him. As ecclesiastics
were, by a regulation of some standing, amenable to
their own laws alone, the churchman denied the competency
of the tribunal. In revenge the king revoked
the concessions of privileges, immunities, and even of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>domains, made by his ancestors to the cathedral of
Lund—a strange and lawless measure, which, if sanctioned
by the nation at large, must have occasioned the
entire ruin of the church. As well might a private
gentleman revoke his father’s will, and reclaim property
of which the bequest has been sanctioned by the
laws of society. The officer who served the act of
revocation was excommunicated by the primate, who
had also the people on his side. Two or three of the
bishops were gained by the court; the rest adhered to
their spiritual head. Every day widened the breach
between the two chief personages in the nation. The
states being convoked at Odinsey to swear allegiance to
Eric, eldest son of the king, Erlandsen refused to appear,
and commanded his suffragans also to refuse.
The rage of the king was unbounded. From the states
which he now convoked at Copenhagen he obtained permission
to seize the primate with the other bishops,
and imprison them. A brother of the primate’s was
the instrument of his apprehension, and he was conveyed
to a fortress in Fionia. The dean and archdeacon
of Lund, with the bishop of Rypen, were next
secured; but the two spiritual peers of Odinsey and
Roskild had time to flee from the realm.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1258 to 1259.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>In his captivity the primate was treated with much
rigour. What his proud spirit could least bear was
insult; if it be true, that he was forced to wear a cap
made from a fox’s skin, we may smile at what called forth
the bitter resentment of himself and the pope. The
king was soon made to repent his violence. In virtue
of the ordinance of the national council at Vedel, the
fugitive bishops laid an interdict on the kingdom; the
pope espoused the cause of his church; and Jaromir,
prince of Rugen, to whose hospitality the bishop of
Roskild had fled, was persuaded by both to arm in behalf
of the altar. Great was the wrath of Christopher
to see the interdict so well observed, and to hear the
murmurs of his people. How could he, alone, resist a
power which had proved fatal to so many emperors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>and so many kings, compared with which his was that
of the meanest vassal in his dominions? In the hope
of obtaining what he called justice, he appealed to
Rome. Yet at the same time he endeavoured to dispose
his royal neighbours of Sweden and Norway in his
favour. <i>They</i>, too, had bishops, and the cause of one
was the cause of all: it was a struggle, he observed,
between the rights of kings and the insolence of their
subjects. They promised to assist him in this war alike
on the pope and his own clergy, whom he was about to
deprive of their temporalities; and had already powerful
armaments in motion when intelligence reached them
that he was no more.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1259.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Whether this monarch died naturally, or through
poison, is doubtful. The suddenness of that death,
and the peculiar circumstances in which he met it,
could not fail to create the suspicion, and with some
minds suspicion is truth. Even the monk whose fanaticism
was said to have occasioned the deed, has been
indicated by name. In the letter, however, which
both his widow and his son addressed to the pope after
this event, no one is implicated, and the charge of poison,
true or false, was merely stated in general and indefinite
terms. That he fell a victim to poison has not been
proved, still less that it was administered by a churchman.
The evidence, however, is rather indicative of a
tragical end, though the causes and the circumstances
must for ever rest a mystery.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>That princess had great courage and great prudence,
and both were required in the peculiarly difficult circumstances
in which she was placed. Some of the
bishops were exiles, some in prison, but all protected
by the pope, and venerated by the people. Eric, the
son of Abel, supported by the counts of Holstein, by
the prince of Rugen, and by the exiled prelates, aspired
to the throne. The interdict still remained, and consequently
the discontent of the people. And now
Jaromir, prince of Rugen, and the duke of Sleswic,
accompanied by the bishop of Roskild, made a descent
on the coast of Zealand, with a formidable army.
Margaret collected what troops she was able, and hastened
to meet the enemy. The battle was disastrous
to the royal party, 10,000 being left on the field. The
consequences were still more disastrous—the occupation
of Zealand, and the destruction of several towns,
(among others Copenhagen, which had recently been
invested with municipal rights,) by the victors. Bornholm
was next reduced, then Scania, which remembered
its primate with gratitude; and the whole
kingdom must have been subjugated by the Slavonic
prince, had not a tragical death arrested him in his
career. This was a heavy loss to the ecclesiastical
party; but the bishop of Roskild confirmed the censure,
and denied Christian burial to the dead of the
royal party. Jutland only remained faithful to the
latter. Yet Margaret was not dismayed: notwithstanding
the interdict and the absolute prohibition
issued alike by the primate and the bishop of Roskild,
she caused her son to be crowned. To soothe in some
degree the animosity of the former, she released him
and all the churchmen; but he would not compromise
what he deemed his duty; he refused all overtures
from her, and retired into Sweden to await the decision
of Rome. For this conduct he has been
much censured by modern historians. They should,
however, remember that he could not do otherwise: the
decision was no longer in his hands, but in those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>the pope, to whom it had been carried by the appeal of
both parties. Alexander IV. was dead; and Urban IV.,
who was raised to the dignity, took cognizance of the
cause. He condemned the primate, and ordered him
to resign his archbishopric into the hands of two ecclesiastical
commissioners whom he nominated for that
purpose. Erlandsen obeyed; but, hearing that Clement IV.
had succeeded to Urban, he hastened to Rome to plead
for himself. Clement did not confirm the judgment of
his predecessor; he took up the case <i>de novo</i>, and sent a
legate to examine on the spot into the circumstances of
the dispute, and to decide according to justice. Erecting
his tribunal at Sleswic, the papal functionary cited the
king and the queen-mother to appear before him; but
they refused on the plea that Sleswic was unfavourable to
them. The plea was a frivolous one, and devised only
to cover their determination not to acknowledge the
competency of the judges. Apprehensive for their
safety in a city which depended on the king, the legate
and the bishops repaired to Lubeck, whence they excommunicated
Eric, his mother, and all who had refused
to obey the citation. The primate retired to Rome,
where he remained about seven years; and during
that period, the interdict remained in full force.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1261 to 1264.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>While these events were passing, others occurred of
still greater moment to the queen and her son. On
the death of Valdemar (1257), eldest son of Abel, who
had been transferred from the dungeons of Cologne to
the ducal palace of Sleswic, and who left no issue, the
succession was claimed by Eric, the next brother.
Abel, who then reigned, had refused to invest him, and
he had therefore thrown himself into the arms of his
kinsmen, the counts of Holstein, and by their aid had
entered on the administration of the duchy. Unable
to dispossess him, Margaret proposed to recognise him,
provided he would acknowledge that he held the fief
by the pure favour of the crown, and not by any right
of inheritance. But in every European country except
Scandinavia fiefs had long been hereditary: they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>become allodial property; and Eric refused to sanction
a condition which must have proved fatal to the hopes
of his family. To chastise him, the queen and her
son marched towards the south; but on the plains of
Sleswic they were signally defeated. Flight did not
save them from the power of their enemies: they were
overtaken and consigned to imprisonment—the former
at Hamburg, in the charge of the counts of Holstein,
the latter in the fortress of Norburg, subject to duke
Eric. There both might have remained to the close of
life (for the bishop and the people were equally disaffected),
had not Albert of Anhalt, who had married
the princess Mechtilda, sister of the king, interfered in
their behalf. The queen was soon released (1263),
and enabled to resume the administration: the king
was confided to the guardianship of John, margrave of
Brandenburg, also connected by the ties of blood with
the royal family. It was at length agreed that he
should be enlarged, on the condition of his marrying
Agnes, daughter of the margrave, whose dowry,
6000 marks, was to be placed against his ransom.
Returning to his capital (1264), he was now old enough
to assume the reins of government.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1272 to 1275.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>In 1272 died Eric, duke of Sleswic—an event
which again disturbed the tranquillity of the country.
He left two sons, Valdemar and Eric, both minors.
To the guardianship a claim was put in by the
king, and another by the counts of Holstein. Both
parties flew to arms, and at first the counts had the
advantage; but seeing the royal forces augmented, they
consented to resign the trust into the royal hands,
on the condition of his investing the eldest with the
duchy when arrived at the due age. Eric now celebrated
his marriage with Agnes of Brandenburg; and
he had also the satisfaction to see the convocation
of a general council, (that of Lyons, 1274,) destined to
remove the interdict from his kingdom. He was,
however, enjoined not merely to receive the primate
into his friendship, but to pay him 15,000 marks by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>way of indemnification. This may appear a large sum,
and it has been censured by historians. They forget,
however, to tell us that during the long absence of the
archbishop, he had been receiving the revenues of the
see—an amount many times greater than the indemnification.
The following year (1275), a national
council held at Lund finished the work of reconciling
the king with the church.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1280 to 1286.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>But if Eric was thus at peace with his spiritual, he
was often in disputes with his temporal, barons, on
whose rights he was always ready to encroach. Notwithstanding
his treaty with the counts of Holstein, he
endeavoured to evade the investiture of Sleswic in favour
of Valdemar. Both parties, however, were equally to
blame; for when Valdemar was invested, he claimed other
domains in Frisia, on the plea that they belonged to
his paternal uncle. When this was refused, he leagued
himself with the enemies of Denmark: the plot was
discovered, and he was imprisoned while at Eric’s court.
But his detention was of short duration; and at the
intercession of his allies, he was enlarged, after subscribing
some conditions which more clearly established
the authority of the crown over the fief. Still, if one
enemy was vanquished, others remained, and to some
of them, or rather to his own vices, the king fell a
victim. To the count of Halland he had been oppressive:
he had deprived him of his domains, and if
report were true, dishonoured the wife during the husband’s
absence. Revenge was sworn, and the oath was
kept. One night, after hunting, he was murdered asleep
at a rural village in Jutland.  The king’s chamberlain
was privy to the design: it was he who guided the
assassins (all in masks) to the bed. They subsequently
fled to Norway, by the king of which they were protected
against the vengeance of Eric’s family.</p>

<p class='c024'>Thus ended a reign of troubles, most of which cannot
with any justice be imputed to the monarch. Yet his
own vices added greatly to his misfortunes. After his
peace with the church, when moderation might have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>been expected from him, he frequently seized the church
tithes, and applied to his own use the produce arising
from the monastic domains. With his nobles he was no
less severe; and more than once (especially in 1262) he
was in danger of being driven from the realm by their
united arms. Eric promulgated the code, called <i>Birkerett</i>,
to the provisions of which we shall allude on a
future occasion.</p>

<p class='c024'>At his father’s death Eric was only twelve years of
age. A guardian and regent was therefore necessary;
and the post was demanded by Valdemar, duke of
Sleswic, the nearest male kinsman of Eric. The queen-mother,
Agnes of Brandenburg, willing but afraid to
refuse, at length recognised his claim. There could
not have been a better choice: he forgot the wrongs of
his family in his new duties. In the first assembly
which he convoked, he called for vengeance on the murderers
of the late king. They were in alarm; and to
escape the consequence, they entered into a plot, the
object of which was to seize the young king, and detain
him as a hostage, until their pardon should be
declared by the states. That plot did not escape the
vigilance of the regent, who took measures to disconcert
it; and also, at the same time, caused a commission to
be appointed, with power to inquire into the circumstances
of Eric Glipping’s death. That commission
consisted of Otho of Brandenburg, brother of the queen-mother;
of Vicislas, prince of Rugen; of the counts of
Holstein, and of twenty-seven Danish nobles. The
result was a verdict of wilful murder against James,
count of Halland, Stig, marshal of the court, and seven
others. Condemned to perpetual banishment, they repaired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>to the court of the Norwegian king, then at war
with Denmark, by whom they were hospitably received.
Assisted by him they were enabled to visit the northern
parts of their fief, and to commit, during many years,
considerable depredations. That the Norwegian monarch
should thus become the ally of murderers—the
murderers, too, of a brother king—might surprise us,
if we did not remember that he and his father had long
applied, but applied in vain, for satisfaction on points, the
justice of which had never been denied. One of them
was, that the dowry of his mother, Ingeburga, a Danish
princess, had never been paid. At the head of a considerable
fleet, he himself soon followed the regicides,
and devastated the coasts. To no proposals of peace
would he listen, unless the regicides were pardoned—for
such was his engagement with them. This war
raged until 1308, when peace was restored in the treaty
of Copenhagen. The chief condition was, that in compensation
for his mother’s dowry, the Norwegian monarch
should hold northern Halland as a fief from Eric
of Denmark. In regard to the regicides, it was stipulated,
that some should be allowed to return and enjoy
their property, but that the more guilty should never
revisit the realm. Yet, even to them a permission during
three years was given to dispose of their lands and personal
substance.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1292 to 1299.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>This long war was not the only trouble of Eric.
Like his two predecessors, he was embroiled with the
church. To Grandt, a dignitary of Roskild, he was
hostile, for reasons apparently which had no foundation.
When that dignitary was elected to the see of Lund, he
refused, like Erlandsen, either to solicit or to accept the
royal confirmation; and he hastened to Rome to obtain
that of the pope. On his return, he was arrested by
Christopher, the king’s brother, and treated with remarkable
severity. His property was seized; he was
made to exchange his pontifical robes for the meanest
rags; he was fastened to the back of a worn-out horse;
and in this state led, amidst the jeers of the royal dependants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>to the fortress of Helsinburg. He was soon
transferred to the castle of Soeburg, where an unwholesome
dungeon, heavy fetters, and meagre fare awaited
him. The same treatment was inflicted on Lange,
another dignitary of Lund; but he had the good fortune
to escape and to reach Boniface VIII. at Avignon
(1295). Some time afterwards, Grandt himself was so
lucky as to escape, and repair to Bornholm, where he
was received as a martyr. He too arrived at Avignon,
and was welcomed by the pope, who observed, with
much truth, that there were many saints that had suffered
less for the church than archbishop Grandt. The
dispute between the king and the church was examined
at Rome, by a commission of cardinals. The award
was a severe one for the king; it sentenced him to pay
the archbishop, by way of indemnification, 49,000
silver marks; and until the money was paid, not only
was his kingdom to remain under an interdict (it had
been subject to one ever since the archbishop was
seized), but he himself was to be excommunicated, and
also his brother Christopher, the instrument of that arrest.
When the king evinced no disposition to pay the
money, the papal legate who had been dispatched to
Denmark for the occasion, sequestered a portion of the
royal revenues in Scania. This measure Eric could
feel; and he threw himself on the mercy of the pope.
Boniface so far relaxed from his severity as to allow the
archbishop to resign his see of Lund, and to abate the
indemnification to 10,000 marks. Grandt subsequently
became archbishop of Bremen, while the papal legate
succeeded to the primacy of Denmark.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1299 to 1319.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>But the whole of Eric’s reign was not disastrous.
Lubeck and the baron of Rostock sued for his protection,
and paid him for it: he obtained from the latter
some augmentation of his territory, and from other
German powers a large sum of money. Tranquillity,
however, for any long period, he was not to enjoy. One
of his worst domestic enemies was his brother Christopher,
who leagued himself with the kings of Sweden,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Norway, and other enemies of the realm. As a punishment,
seeing that leniency had no result, Eric occupied
his domains. He fled to Wratislas, duke of Pomerania,
who espoused his cause; so did the counts of Holstein
and some other princes. In 1317, peace was made,
but Christopher was not restored. Two years afterwards,
the king paid the debt of nature, leaving his
kingdom plunged in debt, occasioned by his efforts to
contend with his misfortunes. He had more discernment
than some of his predecessors. He encouraged
the rising municipalities, to some of which he granted
charters, analogous to those which existed in Germany.
To commerce he was a benefactor; and he was useful
to the judicial administration by the compilation of a
code (in six books), called the Law of Zealand. He
did more; he made a collection of such public acts as
might throw light on the national history.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c023'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Of his offspring,
none survived him; one at least, on whom his
hopes were placed, met a tragical but accidental death;
and grief led his queen to the cloister, where she died a
few months before him. There was nobody therefore
to succeed him but his turbulent brother Christopher,
then in Sweden, whom he advised the states to remove
from the succession.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1319.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>But Christopher was not to be so easily deprived of
what he regarded as his birthright; and when he heard
that he should have a rival in Eric duke of Sleswic, he
commenced his intrigues, and pushed his warlike preparations
with a vigour that showed his determination
to attain his object. The promises which he made to
the nobles, the clergy, and the municipalities, were exceedingly
lavish, and must, if executed, have changed
the government into an aristocratic republic. Few of
these had he the slightest intention of fulfilling; and
as most were never fulfilled, we will not enumerate
them. They answered his purpose, for he was elected by
the states, and at the same time his eldest son Eric was
joined with him in the government.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1320 to 1323.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Though Christopher was thus placed on the throne,
to be soon found that to maintain himself on it, while an
active rival was striving to unseat him, was no easy
matter. He therefore began to lavish grants on his
nobles so as to plunge the crown in new difficulties,
and to threaten the dismemberment of the monarchy.
To the church he showed great deference: he bore,
without complaint, the postponement of his coronation
until it suited the convenience of the primate to return
from abroad; and he engaged never to violate the privileges
which had been usurped. But he had also need
of foreign allies, and to procure them he evinced the
same disregard of the public interests. To Wratislas,
duke of Rugen, he confirmed the investiture of that fief,
with some other domains. To Henry of Mecklenburg,
who held Rostock in pledge, in consideration of money
advanced to the late king, he granted that territory in
perpetuity, as a fief of the Danish crown. With Gerard,
count of Holstein (then count of Rendsburg), he
entered into a closer treaty, by which each engaged to
assist the other, whenever required, with all the disposable
force at his command. The cession of so many
fiefs within and without Denmark Proper, could not
but have fatal consequences. Not less fatal was the
custom of assigning, until payment was made, whole
islands and provinces, in return either for personal services,
or advances of money.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1324 to 1325.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>What all men might have foreseen soon arrived.
Though Christopher was never to impose any tax
without consent of the nobles, and never, in any circumstances,
to require a tax from the church, his necessities
were so great that he soon laid a new and extraordinary
impost on both orders of the state. The nobles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>were to pay one tenth of their annual revenues; the
clergy in an equal proportion; the people still more.
Suddenly one universal cry of resistance arose from
every part of the kingdom. The archbishop boldly declared
that he would resist to the last; that if the king
did not keep his promises made at his accession, no more
would the church or the nobles keep <i>theirs</i>; that they
should consider themselves absolved from their allegiance.
Christopher bent to the influence which he could not resist;
but he had already exasperated his people, and his
relinquishment of the impost did not restore them to good
humour. His next measure was not only censurable,
but in the highest degree unjust: it was to recover by
force of arms the islands, provinces, and domains, which
had been pledged, without paying any portion of the
debt. In these days it may appear almost incredible
that the whole of Scania, nearly one third of the kingdom,
was thus held by one noble. The creditors, thus
deprived of their rights, naturally combined to obtain
justice by force. They were aided by all that were discontented,
and by not a few who had no cause for dissatisfaction,
but who hoped to benefit by a change.
Scania and Zealand were laid waste by fire and sword.
From two of his enemies, viz. the archbishop of Lund,
and Eric duke of Sleswic, he was released by death;
but the latter event, from which he expected so much
advantage, had baneful consequences. Eric left a young
boy, Valdemar. Who was to be the tutor? To obtain
the post, Christopher invaded Sleswic. But he
found a competitor in the very ally on whom he had so
much relied, Gerard of Holstein, who has been styled
the Great, and who, as the maternal uncle of Valdemar,
had equal right to the trust. In the midst of his successes,
after reducing most of the duchy, he was defeated
by this count, and compelled to retire.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1325.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Many of Christopher’s disaffected subjects had been
silent through fear: now that he was vanquished, he
was assailed by one universal complaint. The nobles
demanded their fiefs, the creditors their money, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>people a removal of taxation; and all bitterly complained
of his breach of faith, though that breach was the unavoidable
result of his position. Revolt became general;
and when the states met he was solemnly deposed,
the reason assigned for this measure being “the intolerable
abuse which he had made of his authority.”
When Christopher received this intelligence, he was in
Zealand with his son; at the same time he learned
that count Gerard was advancing. To repel the invader
Eric marched with the disposable troops; but he was
defeated, betrayed into the hands of his enemies, and
consigned to a dungeon. With the loss of that son, his
colleague on the throne, he lost all hope of present resistance;
and with two younger sons he precipitately
left the kingdom. At Rostock he procured aid from
Henry of Mecklenburg and some Vandalic princes, and
returned to struggle for his rights. He reduced a
fortress, but this success did not render the states more
favourable; they persisted in their resolution to elect
another sovereign. Besieged and taken by Gerard, he
was allowed to retire into Germany. He made another
attempt, with equal want of success, was again taken,
and again set free, on the condition of his retiring to
Rostock.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1326 to 1328.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The states assembled at Nyburg to elect a king made
choice of Valdemar, duke of Sleswic, still a minor,—the
chief cause, no doubt, of his election, since there
must be a regency, and the most powerful might
hope to participate in the public spoils. Gerard was
the head of the regency: half a dozen other nobles
were joined with him, and all were eager to derive the
utmost advantage from a tenure of dignity which must
evidently be brief. Gerard obtained the duchy of Sleswic,
in perpetuity. Count John of Holstein was invested
with the islands of Laland, Falster, and Femeren.
Canute Porse, who by Christopher had been created
duke of North Halland, and who yet had been one of the
first to desert that unfortunate king, was confirmed in
the fief in addition to South Halland: it was no longer
to be revocable, but descend to his posterity. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>archbishop of Lunden obtained Bornholm; another
noble had Colding and Rypen; a third, Langeland and
Arroe; in short, the whole country was parcelled out
into petty principalities, which, though feudally subject
to the crown, would be virtually so many sovereignties.
These measures could not fail to displease all who had
any love for their country: a dozen tyrants were more
tyrannical, more rapacious than one; and pity began
to be felt for the absent Christopher. That prince
was not inactive in his retirement at Rostock. By the
most lavish promises he obtained succours of men and
money from some of his allies; and many of his own
nobles, among whom were the primate and the bishops,
engaged to join him as soon as he landed in Denmark.
He did land, and was joined by the bishops of Aarhus
and Rypen, by many nobles, and enabled to obtain
some advantages over the regents. But he had not
learned wisdom by adversity. One of his allies, count
John of Holstein, he converted into a deadly enemy;
and he offended the church by arresting the bishop of
Borglum. The prelate escaped by corrupting his guard,
and hastened to Rome to add the pope to the other
enemies of Christopher. The kingdom was immediately
placed under an interdict.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1329 to 1331.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>In this emergency, Christopher endeavoured to prevent
his expulsion from the realm by resorting to the
same means of bribery that he had before adopted.
To pacify count John, he ceded to him Zealand and
part of Scania, in addition to Laland and Falster,
which he still held. By grants equally prodigal, and
equally ruinous to the state, he endeavoured to secure
the aid of other nobles. So well did he succeed, that
Gerard, abandoned by many supporters, sued for peace.
The articles were signed at Rypen in 1330. Valdemar
was sent back to Sleswic; but the reversion to the
duchy was secured to Gerard in the event of Valdemar’s
dying without heirs male. As this was merely a future
and contingent advantage, Fionia was placed in his
hands until Sleswic should become his by inheritance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and for that island he was to become the vassal of the
Danish crown. Nor was this all: he was to hold the
whole of Jutland by way of pledge until reimbursed for
the expenses of the war, which he estimated at forty
thousand marks.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1331 to 1332.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>This tranquillity was of short duration. The two
counts, Gerard and John, quarrelled; and Christopher,
instead of remaining neuter, espoused the cause of the
latter. He was defeated by Gerard; and the greater
part of Jutland withdrew from him to swell the cause
of the victor. His only resource was now to throw
himself on the generosity of the other, who professed
his willingness to make peace in return for one hundred
thousand marks; and until that sum (immense for those
days) were paid, he was to hold Jutland. The two
counts also treated with each other, John surrendering to
Gerard one half of the debt on Fionia; and they agreed
to guarantee each other in the acquisitions which they
had made, that is, in the dismemberment of the realm.
At the same time Scania escaped for a season from the
sceptre of the Danish kings. That province had passed
into the hands of John, count of Holstein, through the
inability of the crown to discharge the loans which had
been borrowed on it. Holstein collectors therefore
overran it to collect the revenues claimed by the representative
of the creditors. They were even more unpopular
than those of the king had been; and the
natives not unfrequently arose to massacre them. Three
hundred were at one time put to death in the cathedral
of Lund. To escape chastisement the inhabitants looked,
not to Christopher, who was helpless as an infant, and
whom they distrusted, but to Magnus king of Sweden.
Him they proposed to recognise as their sovereign, on
the condition of his defending them against the counts
of Holstein. It is almost needless to add that Magnus
joyfully availed himself of the opportunity of obtaining
a province which was geographically within the limits
of his kingdom, and which had always been an object
of desire to his predecessors. He received the homage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>of the whole country, and sent forces to defend it. Instead
of drawing the sword to recover it, John sold his
interest in it, and all claim to its government or revenues,
for thirty-four thousand marks—a sum which
Magnus readily paid him. The latter had now a double
right to the province—that of voluntary submission,
and that of purchase.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1332, 1333.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>In the last year of Christopher’s life, two of his
nobles, in the view of obtaining the favour of the Holstein
family, entered into a plot for his assassination.
They set fire to his house, seized him as he was escaping,
and bore him to a fortress in the isle of Laland, which
belonged to count John. That nobleman, however, no
longer feared a prince who had fallen into universal contempt,
and whose cause was hopeless. He therefore
ordered him to be released. The following year Christopher
died a natural death, after the most disastrous
reign in the annals of the kingdom.—By his wife Euphemia,
daughter of Bogislas, duke of Pomerania, he
had three sons and three daughters. Eric, the eldest,
preceded him to the tomb; Otho ultimately became a
knight of the Teutonic order; Valdemar, after a short
interregnum, succeeded him. Of his daughters two
died in youth; but the eldest, Margaret, was married
to Ludovic of Brandenburg, son of the emperor Ludovic
of Bavaria.</p>

<p class='c024'>The two counts of Holstein, who had thus partitioned
the kingdom between them, consulted how they
might perpetuate their usurpation. The best mode was
to delay as long as possible the election of a new monarch;
to exclude the two sons of the late king from the
succession; and, when an election could no longer be
avoided, to procure the union of the suffrages in favour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>of some prince whom they might control. In any
case as their sway might and probably must be brief,
their interest lay in deriving the utmost advantage in
the shortest possible time from their position. Hence
their rapacity, which their armies enabled them to exercise
with impunity.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1334 to 1340.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Under no circumstances would the domination of
strangers have been long borne without execration: that
of rapacious strangers was doubly galling. The murmurs
which arose on every side emboldened the two sons
of Christopher to strive for his inheritance. But they
entered the field before their preparations were sufficiently
matured. Otho, with a handful of troops
supplied by his brother-in-law the margrave of Brandenburg,
landed in Jutland. He evidently relied on
the popular indignation entertained towards the two
usurpers; but he overlooked their means, their military
talents, and the ascendancy which years of success had
given. He was vanquished, and committed to close
confinement, from which he did not escape for many
years. To avert another invasion by excluding the
sons from all hope to the succession, Gerard turned
towards Valdemar, duke of Sleswic, who had been
placed on the throne during Christopher’s exile. If
the duke succeeded, the duchy became the inheritance
of count Gerard; but he would not wait
for probabilities. In return for his promised aid, Valdemar,
in a solemn treaty, agreed to surrender that
province <i>immediately</i>; and if he did not obtain the
object of his ambition, he was to receive Jutland in lieu
of it. The rights of Gerard over that peninsula, in
virtue of the one hundred thousand marks which he
claimed from the crown, have been mentioned: these
rights therefore he might transfer. In the midst of
the negotiation prince Valdemar prepared to return and
conquer, or to share the fate of his brother Otho. The
people were almost universally favourable to him; and
his arrival was expected with impatience. When the
Jutlanders heard of the treaty which consigned them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Valdemar of Sleswic, they no longer waited for their
prince, but openly revolted. Gerard was compelled
to retreat, but only to return with ten thousand German
auxiliaries; and with these he laid waste the peninsula.
His fate, however, was at hand. A Jutland noble, with
fifty accomplices only, resolved to rid his country of a
tyrant. Hastening to Randers, where the count lay
with four thousand men, at midnight, he disarmed the
guard, penetrated into the bedchamber of the regent,
murdered him, and escaped before the army was aware
of the deed.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1340.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Thus perished Gerard, surnamed the Great, a prince
of great talents, and of greater ambition. With him
perished the grandeur of his house. His sons had not
his personal qualities, and they could not maintain
themselves in the position in which he left them. Emboldened
by the event, the states met, and declared the
absent Valdemar, the third son of Christopher (Otho
was still in confinement), heir to the throne. The
act of election was sent to that prince in spite of the
care taken by the counts of Holstein to prevent all
intercourse between the country and the exile. Valdemar
received it at the court of the emperor, Ludovic
of Bavaria; and that monarch immediately enjoined
his son, the margrave, to facilitate the return of his
brother-in-law. Under the imperial sanction, there
was a conference at Spandau. It was there agreed that
Otho should receive his liberty on the condition of
his resigning all claims to the crown. The new king
engaged to marry Hedwige, sister of Valdemar, duke
of Sleswic, whose dowry of 24,000 marks was to be
deducted from the 100,000 claimed by the sons of
count Gerard. Until the rest were paid, Fionia and a
part of Jutland were to remain in the hands of the
counts. The king was not to protect the murderers of
the late count. There were some other conditions of
much less moment—all dictated by the necessity of
sacrificing much to obtain a greater advantage. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>treaty having been solemnly ratified, Valdemar returned
to Denmark, and ascended the throne without
opposition.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1340.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>When this prince ascended the throne, the prospect
before him was gloomy: there was no monarchy;
there were no revenues. Scania and Holland were in
the hands of the Swedes; Fionia and Jutland were
forcibly held by the counts of Holstein; Zealand and
Laland obeyed another chief; and the rest of the isles
had each its ruler who regarded it as his own estate to
be inherited by his children. Even these were not the
worst evils. The anarchy of so many years had caused
the laws to be forgotten; the feeble were every where
a prey to the strong; the poor were at war with the
rich, the native with the foreigner; and nobody thought
either of obedience to authority, or of paying the contributions
rendered necessary by the wants of society.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1340 to 1344.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The two first objects of Valdemar were to make the
laws respected, and to recover, one by one, by conquest
or treaty, the domains which had been alienated. Without
the former there could be no security; without
the latter there could be no prosperity. To make the
judges respected, he himself administered justice. Not
for days only but for weeks and months in succession,
he thus presided in the tribunals, both in the cities
and in the rural towns. At the same time, he caused
most of the nobles in whose vicinity he happened to
be, to produce their titles to the domains which they
held; and when these were not valid, he resumed
the fiefs. Against Ingeborga, widow of duke Albert
Porse, to whose rapacity we have already alluded, he
instituted a suit, and recovered two lordships from
her; but in the very court of justice he had his armed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>men—a proof that the judgment would be in his
favour, and, in spite of all opposition, enforced. The
firm demeanour of the monarch had a good effect on
his people, who rose against their foreign oppressors,
while the latter defended themselves with their accustomed
valour. This desultory warfare raged for
many years.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1344.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The recovery of several domains by justice, or force
of arms encouraged the king to persevere in his efforts.
But there were some parties against whom neither
would avail—who were too powerful for either, and
before them he could appear with money only. Where
should he obtain it? He looked to Magnus, king of
Sweden, who did not feel quite secure in the possession
of Scania, and from whom he obtained 49,000 marks as
the condition of for ever ceding that province to the
northern kingdom. That one so patriotic as Valdemar
should thus sanction the ruinous dismemberment of
the monarchy, may well surprise us. But probably
he reasoned thus:—“If the province <i>be</i> lost, let that
loss be counterbalanced by other acquisitions: if it be
not finally lost,—if circumstances should arise favourable
to my recovering it,—let the fortune of war decide
whether the purchase-money is to be returned or not.”
Of that money he made a good use: he redeemed
from count John of Holstein the isle of Falster, with
many domains and castles in other parts; soon too he
redeemed Vordengburg and the whole isle of Laland.
By this means he increased his own power in the same
degree that he weakened that of his enemies. There
must, however, have been some concert between the
two parties, since he received no molestation in his
financial proceedings, and especially since in 1345 he
was able to leave the kingdom to settle the affairs of
Esthonia.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1345 to 1348.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>In that country there was a revolt of the whole servile
population against their lords, of whom most were Germans.
The grand master of the Teutonic knights being
requested to succour the local feudatories, consented to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>do so; but from his measures it was evident that he
aimed at supplanting the Danish monarch. Valdemar
sailed to the coast; but on his arrival he found that a
truce had been signed between his own governors and
the other party. From thence he proceeded to the
Holy Land—probably in consequence of some vow—and
this circumstance proves that his kingdom must
have been in a more secure state than the chroniclers of
the age would have us believe. By the pope he is said
to have been censured for presuming to visit the holy
places without the licence of the apostolic see. His absence,
however, must have been short; for in the following
year (1346) he was again in Esthonia. His
motive for this second expedition may be inferred from
the result; he sold that province to the Teutonic knights
for 19,000 marks. This act has been much censured
by historians; but to us it appears a wise one. The
expense of maintaining that distant possession was
greater than it was worth: troops could not be spared
for it when every disposable man was required at home;
and the money was necessary to pay some importunate
demands, and to redeem another portion of the national
domains. Well was that money employed; it enabled
him to recover all the fortresses in Jutland and Zealand
that had not been previously redeemed. In exchange
for other possessions, he received from the counts of
Holstein one half of Fionia and the town of Nyburg.
This circumstance confirms what we have just mentioned—that
the intervals of war were neither so frequent
nor so long as those of peace; that he lived with
the counts and his other rivals on terms much less hostile
than from the strict language of the chroniclers we
should be justified in believing.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1348 to 1350.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Another opportunity of replenishing his empty treasury
was opened to Valdemar in the aid which he
afforded to his brother-in-law the margrave of Brandenburg,
son of the emperor Ludovic of Bavaria. For
that aid he received the annual tribute which the city
of Lubeck paid to the margrave’s family for the protection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>(or advocacy, as it was called during the middle
ages) afforded by that family to the commerce of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1351 to 1357.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>On his return to Denmark the king proceeded with
as much zeal as before in the reforms he had meditated.
Rigour was required, and he employed it; but it converted
into enemies all whose evil deeds he chastised.
This was the most formidable of the obstacles which
impeded his career of improvement. A whole generation
of anarchy had rendered the nobles impatient of
all restraint; they sighed for their former impunity;
and they hated a ruler who in the administration of the
laws made no distinction between them and the meanest
artisan. To humble this tyrant as they considered him,
they renewed their alliance with the counts of Holstein;
but it led to nothing at this time: these nobles had yet
no need to renew the war with the king. Four years
afterwards, however (in 1357), they joined the Jutland
nobility, and the king, who marched to repel them, was
defeated. But the check was of short duration; for in
a few weeks he was the victor in his turn—Adolf, one
of the counts, being left dead on the field. This was a
useful victory: it enabled Valdemar to seize the other
half of Fionia without payment of the mortgage. The
following year he subdued Langeland, Alfen, Femeren.
The second of them, which belonged to the duke of
Sleswic he subsequently restored, security being given
that the inhabitants would remain neutral in the contest
between him and the house of Holstein. With
that house, however, peace was soon made; but these
alternations of war and peace are perpetual at this period.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1357 to 1360.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>If Valdemar had ceded to Sweden the important
province of Scania, he had done so either unwillingly,
or with the resolution of recovering it whenever the
opportunity should occur. That opportunity at length
presented itself, and in a manner different from his
anticipations. King Magnus became so unpopular,
that he was compelled to resign the throne in favour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>his son Eric. To regain it, he solicited aid from Valdemar;
but the latter would promise none unless Scania
were restored. The condition was a hard one; but the
prize in view was of more importance; and in a treaty
(1359) Magnus conceded the demand. At the same time,
to draw closer the alliance between them, Margaret,
daughter of Valdemar, then only six years old, was affianced
to Hako king of Norway, another son of Magnus.
In accordance with this treaty, Valdemar invaded Scania;
and in a short time reduced most of the fortresses. From
this career of conquest, however, he was recalled, for a
moment, by an invasion of Femeren. The invaders
were the counts of Holstein, the duke of Mecklenburg,
and many nobles of Jutland, who were resolute in
hastening the downfall of a stern master. This was a
diversion effected by the counts to save Scania, in the
preservation of which to the Swedish crown they had
an interest. They were the allies of Eric, who had
rebelled against his father Magnus; and their sister
Elizabeth, in lieu of the Danish princess, was intended
for Hako. The advantage lay with the king, who
having forced his enemies to disband, returned to Scania,
which he wholly seized. This he did without
much difficulty, owing to a revolution in the internal
state of Sweden. Eric, who had been associated with
Magnus in the government, who was hostile to every
thing Danish, who was the close ally of the counts of
Holstein, fell a victim, we are told, to his own mother’s
ambition. Magnus therefore resumed the sole direction
of affairs, and the Danish interest again predominated.
He was indeed enjoined by the states to
defend Scania; but though he marched towards that
province, he made no effort to arrest the progress of
the Danes. On the contrary, he entered into a new alliance
with them, and the projected union between
Margaret and Hako was confirmed.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1360 to 1363.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Magnus had again need of his ally’s assistance against
his rebellious subjects.  The inhabitants of Wisby,
capital of the isle of Gothland, refused to pay the impost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>which he had laid upon them; and Valdemar, in
obedience to his wish, sailed to chastise them. Wisby
was one of the greatest ports in Europe; it was the
magazine where the merchandise of the Baltic was
kept. Of this much belonged to the Hanse Towns,
especially to Lubeck. Immense was the booty which
the Danish monarch seized in that town; but why he
should plunder the subjects of his ally for his own
benefit, is not easy to be explained. Whatever were his
own reasons, he soon repented of his violence. The
Swedes, indignant with their monarch whom they knew
to have been the occasion of the disaster, shut him up
in a fortress, called Hako of Norway to aid them, and
declared war against Denmark. To obtain more assistance,
they entered into alliance with the enemies of
Denmark,—with the counts of Holstein, with the duke
of Mecklenburg, and with the Hanse Towns, which were
justly exasperated at the plunder of Wisby. The confederated
powers put their armaments in motion, and
soon reduced Copenhagen. Helsingburg in Scania
was besieged, but Valdemar raised the siege and defeated
the allied fleet with great loss. Vordingburg
was next assailed, but with no better success; and
other disasters soon rendered the allies anxious for peace,
which was concluded at Lubeck in 1363. But it was
of short continuance. There was a general meeting of
deputies from all the towns of the Hanseatic League,
above seventy in number; and the result of their deliberations
was a new war. It was indeed evident, that
unless that body secured the free transit of merchandise,
there must be an end to all mercantile enterprise,
and the worst days of piracy must be restored.
Two armaments were soon equipped; and the number
of assailants was increased by the adhesion of Denmark’s
hereditary enemies. Valdemar, terrified, had
recourse to negociations. Adolf, count of Holstein, he
detached from the league by investing him with the
isle of Femeren. The Hanse Towns he propitiated by
commercial privileges. A truce was accordingly made,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>and the king was left to resume his intrigues in the
North.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1362 to 1363.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>After the imprisonment of Magnus, who, however,
was soon allowed to share in the government, Hako
was the only hope of the Swedes: they crowned him in
1362, and then urged him to marry the sister of the
counts of Holstein. But the breach of the contract between
Margaret and Hako could not be so easily dissolved:
it had been written and sealed with the necessary
formalities, and under the sanction of an oath.
Yet the Swedish states, regardless of these circumstances,
sent an ambassador to Holstein to perform the
marriage ceremony by proxy. It was celebrated with
much pomp; and, soon afterwards, the new queen of
Norway and Sweden embarked for her destination.
The intelligence was a blow to Valdemar; but fortune
enabled him to recover from it. A tempest cast the
bride on the Danish coast; and she was conducted to
the court, where the most flattering reception awaited
her. A succession of feasts and entertainments blinded
her for some time to the designs of Valdemar; but at
length she perceived that with all the humour so studiously
paid her, she was little better than a prisoner.
But little did she suspect the deep game that was playing.
During her stay at the court, which was protracted
for many weeks, Hako was induced to visit the
country and to solemnize his marriage with the princess
Margaret. Great was the joy of the Danes at this
event, and no less great the mortification of that numerous
party in Sweden, which had prosecuted the alliance
with Holstein. As Margaret was still very young, the
marriage was not consummated for three years afterwards.
But the advantage was gained; and Elizabeth,
in despair, took the veil in a Swedish monastery.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1363.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>This marriage deserves especial consideration from one
circumstance;—it led to the union of the crowns between
Denmark and Norway,—a union which has continued
unbroken to our own days. For a considerable
period too it occasioned a junction of the three kingdoms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>which constitute Scandinavia. Many obstacles,
however, intervened, before it could be effected; and
indeed there was no hope of such a result at the time
of its celebration. So indignant were the Swedes at it,
that they declared the throne vacant, and elected Albert
of Mecklenburg to rule over them. Hako, like his father,
therefore, lost the crown; but these circumstances
can be detailed only in the chapter devoted to Swedish
history.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1364, 1365.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The next year was passed by Valdemar abroad, in
Germany, Poland, Hungary, Italy, and France. Why
he should abandon the kingdom at so critical a period
has exercised the ingenuity of historians; but none of
their conjectures are satisfactory; and his motions must
remain shrouded in mystery. On his return, after an
absence of ten months, he found his own kingdom as
tranquil as Sweden was stormy. In the latter there
were two parties—that which adhered to Magnus and
Hako, and that which had invited Albert to ascend
the throne. The former, numerically inferior, had obtained
succour from Norway and Denmark, and, with
this aid, had made an irruption into the provinces
which held for Albert. A battle ensued, in which
Magnus was made prisoner; but Hako, though desperately
wounded, contrived to escape. But Valdemar
recruited his party; and by his arms, no less than his
intrigues, reduced Albert to such perplexity, that he
was compelled, whatever the price, to propitiate the
formidable Dane. Overtures were accordingly made
to Valdemar by the kinsmen of Albert; and he received
them with eagerness. They were, however, delusive;
not one of the promises made was executed, or intended
to be executed.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1367 to 1370.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The influence of Albert, and of his connections,
proved more disastrous to Valdemar than he could have
expected. His own subjects, especially those of Jutland,
who were in league with the counts of Holstein,
again broke out into open rebellion. They were aided
by the king of Sweden (Albert), by the duke of Mecklenburg,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>by the Hanse Towns, and by other enemies of
Denmark. The most extraordinary circumstance is,
that at this very period, when the monarchy was menaced
within and from without, Valdemar again left the kingdom
to pass several months abroad! Was his intention
to interest the emperor and the pope in his behalf?
Such has been the opinion of writers. Others, again,
have attributed his departure to a formidable conspiracy,
the object of which was darkly seen by him. The
subject must remain in mystery. The hypothesis of a
conspiracy, however, derives some confirmation from
the fact, that after his departure the Hanseatic Towns,
the counts of Holstein, and Albert of Sweden, made
simultaneous attacks on different parts of the kingdom,
and with some degree of success. In 1370, however,
the minister to whom Valdemar had confided the affairs
of the realm made peace with all the enemies of Denmark.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1370 to 1375.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The same year Valdemar returned, and the same year
too witnessed the extinction of the ducal line of Sleswic,
which, as we have before related, originated in Abel,
king of Denmark. To recover the duchy was the object
of Valdemar, long before duke Henry’s death; and
when that event arrived, his measures were so well
taken, that in a few weeks most of the fortresses were
in his possession. But the counts of Holstein urged
their claim, in virtue of the agreement between their
father, Gerard, and the duke of that period. They did
not, however, immediately proceed to hostilities, nor
was it their fortune to measure swords with Valdemar,
while busily occupied in the internal reforms which he
had so long contemplated, he saw that war was inevitable;
and in this apprehension he besought pope Gregory
XI. to interfere in his behalf—to teach his subjects
obedience, and his enemies moderation. The pope, in
his reply, professed his willingness to espouse the royal
cause; but before his interference could be availing,
Valdemar was no more. He died through his confidence
in a quack, whose medicines he took. By his queen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Hedwige, he had six children, four of whom preceded
him to the tomb. The survivors were two daughters—Ingeburga,
married to Henry duke of Mecklenburg,
and the celebrated Margaret, afterwards queen of the
North.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1375.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Valdemar was the first Danish monarch that styled
himself king of the <i>Goths</i>. The assumption was occasioned,
either by the conquests which he made in Gothland
(they were very temporary), or by the diversions
which Albert, to preserve his alliance, proposed to make,
and, in fact, did make, in that province.</p>

dynasty founded by Sweyn, the nephew of Canute the
Great. Who was to succeed him? As we have before
related, he left two daughters only; viz. Ingeburga,
wife of Henry, duke of Mecklenburg, and Margaret,
the consort of Hako, king of Norway. As there was no
example in the North of female succession, the electors
must turn either to some collateral branch of the family,
or to the sons of those princesses,—unless indeed they
did what they might easily have done, and what many
indeed professed to do, viz. make choice of a foreign
house. The greater number, however, decided for preserving
the sceptre in the ancient house, and without
regard to the collateral branches. The choice therefore
rested between the issue of Ingeburga and that of Margaret;
viz. between Albert of Mecklenburg, and Olaf
of Norway. The former was the eldest daughter, and
Albert was much older than Olaf, yet merely a child;
but the feeling of the states seemed to run in favour of
the latter. In the first assembly nothing was effected;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>in the interval between it and the convocation of the
next, Margaret was not inactive. Her intrigues, her
presents, her promises, and above all the fact that Olaf
was the heir of the Norwegian throne, and consequently
that there would be a union of the two kingdoms, determined
the question in his favour. In this decision
too, dislike of Sweden had some share; for Albert was
nearly connected with the king who had been elected the
successor of Magnus. On this occasion, there was no
general meeting of the states; and those of each province
voted separately. Jutland, with its three orders, viz.
the nobles, the clergy, the burghers and rich peasants, set
the example. It was followed by Scania; and the rest,
constrained by their preponderating influence, joined
with them.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1376.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The promises of the queen to which we have alluded
were not dissimilar from those which Christopher II.
had made. In the name of her son (he was but five
years of age), she guaranteed to the clergy all their
rights, immunities, and privileges. No benefice should
be held by a layman. No foreigner should become a
dignitary. No bishop or any other ecclesiastic should
be arrested, exiled, or deprived of his revenues, without
the previous sentence of an ecclesiastical judge only.
Abbots, friars, and rectors, were to be dependent only
on the bishop, their lawful superior. The nobles and
not the crown were to receive the fines inflicted on the
rural inhabitants within their respective districts by any
secular judge, when those fines fell below a certain
amount, according to the custom of the province: in
some provinces the maximum was three, in others nine
marks; when it exceeded three or nine, it went indisputably
to the crown. The king was to undertake no
war without the consent of his senators, the prelates,
and some nobles of the realm. No man in holy orders
should be invested with any temporal employment. No
man should be executed unless he had been judicially
convicted, or caught <i>flagrante delicto</i> in some matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>worthy of death. Even if he had been sentenced by
the tribunals, one month and a day should be allowed
him to flee from the kingdom! The peasants should
not be compelled to repair the royal palaces, without the
sanction of the senate. The king should not build on
any other domain than his own, without the consent of
the owner. The property of no man should be confiscated,
even judicially, unless he were proved guilty of
high treason, or had borne arms against his country.
Foreign merchants might trade freely throughout the
kingdom, and should be subject to no other tax or impost
than such as were already sanctioned by custom.
The great assizes should, according to ancient custom,
be held annually on the feast of St. John the Baptist.
No officer of justice should cite any one before a foreign
tribunal—that of Norway, for instance—but every
man should be amenable to the local jurisdiction alone.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1376.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Such were the chief provisions of the capitulation
between Margaret and the people. They have been
severely condemned by the national historians, as trenching
on the just prerogatives of the crown. But surely
they do not all merit the censure. Some of them are
in the highest degree salutary. That indeed which
allowed the nobles to enjoy the fines levied on their
vassals, or more correctly freemen (subject, however, to
many vassalitic obligations), was censurable; but it
was common in most other countries where feudal tribunals
existed. Two or three of those which concerned
the clergy are also reprehensible; but they were
sanctioned by the canon law, and were as obligatory in
other places as in Denmark. The greatest defect of
this capitulation is that too much influence was left to
the nobles. But how should Margaret be condemned
for sacrificing to the aristocracy, when aristocratic privileges
were predominant every where else?</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1376 to 1380.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The election of Olaf could not fail to exasperate the
party of Albert. The head of the house of Mecklenburg
called in the emperor Charles IV. to interfere in
behalf of his grandson: he flew to arms, and persuaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>his son Albert, king of Sweden, to join him; and he
brought the courts of Holstein into the same league.
These counts, in the event of Albert’s succession, were
to have Sleswic, Alfen, and Langeland. On her part,
Margaret was not idle. She too obtained allies, among
whom were the dukes of Pomerania, the hereditary
enemies of the Mecklenburg family. The result justified
her policy. A formidable armament sailed against
the coasts, and she was prepared to meet it. The elements,
however, fought for her: the armament was
dispersed or destroyed; and the enemy consented that
the great subjects of dispute should be laid before arbitrators.
This was to acknowledge Olaf <i>de facto</i> sovereign
of Denmark, whatever the concessions expected
from him in return. Whether this arbitration ever took
place is not very clear: there are no records of it; yet
there is some reason to suspect that it did, and that
from the period in question the house of Mecklenburg
was excepted from all homage for the lordship of Rostock.
What confirms the inference is, that for some
years the realm was undisturbed by foreign enemies,
and the regent left at liberty to pursue her course of
policy. That course was a judicious one. She drew
closer the connection between Denmark and the Hanseatic
Towns; she courted the clergy; she was gracious
to the barons; she endeavoured to remove all subjects
of discord, and to bind all orders of the people to her
government.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1380 to 1386.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>In 1380, Hako, the husband of Margaret, who was
greatly her senior, paid the debt of nature. Olaf therefore,
still a child, became king of Norway. But Hako
was also the rightful heir to the Swedish throne, and
these rights Margaret determined to secure in favour of
their legitimate heir, her son. This indeed was the
great, the constant, object of her policy: she had united
two kingdoms, and she would now add a third. The mortification
of the Swedish king was great. He feared lest
the strength of the two hostile kingdoms should be consolidated,
and become fatal to himself. To avert this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>result, he had recourse to hostilities, during the absence
of Olaf and his mother in Norway (1381). Though
he effected some mischief, he made little impression on
that country. Two years afterwards, he made a second
attempt, but was compelled to retreat. In 1385, both
Olaf and his mother repaired thither to confirm the people
in their fidelity, and to gain their attachment by
such marks of favour as sovereigns can bestow.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1386.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>In regard to the counts of Holstein, Margaret had
more trouble than with Albert of Sweden, or the prince
of Mecklenburg. These counts, as we have often intimated,
looked to Sleswic as their lawful inheritance;
nor had they relinquished their hope of succession after
the reversion of the fief to the crown through the default
of issue in Henry the late duke. To the surprise
of many, count Gerard, grandson of the celebrated
prince of that name, was formally invested by Olaf with
that important fief. In dismembering (for the act was
no better) so important a limb of the Danish body, there
was certainly much impolicy; but the act is neither so
surprising nor so censurable as some historians assert.
In fact there are strong reasons for it. Gerard, the representative
of his house, had, according to feudal law, a
good claim to the succession. Its justice, therefore,
would have weight, not merely with the allies of his
house, but with all Germany. Policy, however, more
than justice, influenced the queen-mother in this important
step. Was it nothing to separate the interests of
the Holstein count from those of the Mecklenburg
dukes? She well knew the efforts which Albert of
Sweden had made, and was making, to secure the active
assistance of the former. Besides, most of her subjects,
and all her noble subjects, looked upon the count as
hardly used by his exclusion from his birthright; and
they were not without apprehension that, if left as a
precedent, it might operate to their own disadvantage.
But the strongest of all reason is, that the count was
already <i>de facto</i> duke of Sleswic. Soon after the death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>of Valdemar III., he had, with the aid of his allies,
occupied it by force; and as the people were attached
to his government, who was to dispossess him? Certainly
to do so was not in the power of the queen-mother,
or of her son. But though the standard—the
ordinary symbol of infeudation—was delivered by
Olaf to the count, and homage done in return, no letters-patent
were expedited on the occasion. Why? Because
there was a dispute as to the conditions of the tenure by
which the fief was to be held. Gerard wished to hold it
on the same footing as his celebrated ancestor, viz.
without the obligation of military service; but from
that wish Margaret dissented. The subject, therefore,
was left undecided, and it gave rise, as we shall perceive
in the ensuing volume, to much effusion of blood.
Connected with this count Gerard is one circumstance
worthy of notice: his sister Hedwige married Theodric
count of Oldenburg; and from that union sprung
Christian I., king of Denmark, founder of the illustrious
family which now sits on the throne.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1387.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>One year after this important investiture, Olaf, whose
constitution had always been feeble, paid the debt of
nature. As he was only in his seventeenth year, he left
no issue, and indeed was never married. Again, therefore,
was the male line extinct; and Margaret only could
rule, unless (what nobody contemplated) a foreign
house should be called to the succession. The queen-mother
had so obvious an interest in the event, that by
some people she was suspected of having quietly removed
her son to reign in his place. The suspicion,
indeed, was an absurd one: there was not the shadow
of a foundation for it; but it suited popular credulity;
and it enabled, as we shall hereafter show, a false Olaf
to deceive a considerable portion of the multitude. The
Franciscans contend that the king, influenced by piety
alone, relinquished his worldly grandeur, and retired to
a house of their order in Italy, where he died in all the
odour of sanctity.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>By this monarch’s decease Margaret became sovereign
of both Denmark and Norway; and from this
period down to the nineteenth century, both crowns
were united on the same brow. Henceforth the fortunes
of both are inseparable. Our next care must
be to give a summary of Norwegian events prior to this
union.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>After</span> the death of St. Olaf<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c023'><sup>[159]</sup></a>, <span class='sc'>Canute the Great</span>
was the undisputed sovereign of Norway. The care
of three kingdoms being too great even for his strength,
he confided the government of Norway, with the
regal title, to his son <span class='sc'>Sweyn</span>, to whom, in his last will,
he bequeathed the crown. But Sweyn was no favourite
with his new subjects. Independently of the
mortifying reflection that he was not one of their own
race, but had been forced on them by conquest, his own
conduct was not of a kind to remove the prejudice against
him. That in the distribution of fiefs and honours he gave
a preference to Danes, is probable enough; that he had
no affection for a people who detested him, is equally so;
but had his impartiality been strict, and his virtues undeniable,
he never could have founded a dynasty in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>country. It was only fear of his father, the greatest
monarch of his times, that kept them in subjection;
and no sooner did they hear of that monarch’s death,
than they looked towards Magnus, son of St. Olaf, then
an exile in Russia.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c023'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1035.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Magnus, as we before related<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c023'><sup>[161]</sup></a>, was a bastard son of
that odd saint by his concubine Alfhilda. He accompanied
his father in the exile to Holmgard, and there
he remained during that father’s unfortunate expedition
to Norway. Left an orphan, he was well entertained
by his host, the grand prince of Russia. Here he
received intelligence of Canute’s death, of the unpopularity
of Sweyn, and of the anxiety with which his
return was expected. Proceeding to Sweden, he was
honourably received by Emund, and by his step-mother
Astrida<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c023'><sup>[162]</sup></a>, sister of that monarch. Owing to her influence,
a small but resolute band of armed men accompanied
him into Norway. As he passed the mountains
into Drontheim, the adherents of Sweyn fled in great
alarm towards the southern provinces; and Sweyn himself
followed the example. In his progress, Magnus
received many evidences of the popular goodwill. At
Nidaros, the capital, his reception was enthusiastic. To
the Thing assembled on the occasion, flocked a multitude
of men friendly to his cause; and there he was
solemnly elected king.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1035, 1036.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The first care of <span class='sc'>Magnus I.</span> was to reward his followers
by conferring on them the governments which
had been held by Sweyn’s adherents. His next was to
collect troops and march against his rival. To assert
his rights, the latter, who was then in Hadaland, sent
out the arrow of war in every direction; and many
hastened to his summons. In the midst of the assembly,
he asked whether they were ready to join him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>in resisting Magnus. Some expressed their consent;
some openly refused; the greater number hesitated;
but disaffection to his cause was so evident in the great
body, that he declared his resolution of seeking more
faithful defenders. Leaving Norway, he repaired to
Denmark, where, that very year, he died. Harda-Canute,
as we have before related, claimed the crown
of Norway; but hostilities were closed by the singular
compact, that if either died without children, he should
succeed to the states of the other.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1038 to 1040.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Astrida, the widow of St. Olaf, had accompanied
Magnus into Norway; and such had been the aid she
had procured him, that he gratefully settled her in his
palace, showing her the utmost honour. But, at the
same time, he sent for his mother Alfhilda, whom he
treated with more affection but with less honour. Indignant
at this distinction, she insisted on more than
an equality, which Astrida being unwilling to grant, the
two ladies could no longer reside in the same house.
In his kingdom Magnus had more influence than in his
palace, he effectually restored tranquillity, and became
popular. Of his deceased father miracles were reported.
The mere report was enough: he pretended to believe
it; he well knew what honour would be his through
his descent from a saint; and he caused the relics of the
royal martyr to be placed in a magnificent casket, and
displayed for the veneration of the faithful.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1042 to 1046.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>On the death of Harda-Canute, Magnus, in accordance
with the compact which had been made between
them, proceeded to Denmark, to take possession of the
throne. His claim, as we have before observed, was
admitted by his new subjects. We have related his
transaction with Sweyn, son of Estrith, the sister of Canute,
and the founder of the line of kings who sat above
three centuries on the Danish throne. Nor need we
again recur to his transactions with Harald, surnamed
Hardrade, or the Stern, whom he admitted to a participation
in the kingdom. Few men in his circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>could have acted more wisely, yet, with all his mildness,
he was a firm supporter of his own rights; and more
than once he made his remarkable colleague feel that
there was a distance between them.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c023'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1047.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The demise of Magnus immediately followed his successful
expedition in Denmark to avenge the rebellion of
Sweyn. The son of a saint could scarcely leave the world
without some manifestation of divine favour.  In a
dream his father Olaf appeared to him, and ordered him
to make his choice between two proposals—either to
die, and join the deceased king in heaven, or to live the
most powerful of monarchs, yet commit some crime for
which he could hardly expect the divine forgiveness.
He instantly chose the former alternative; and was immediately
afflicted with a disease the result of which,
to the great sorrow of his people, was fatal. He was a
great and good prince; as much superior to his father
in intellect and moral worth as one man can be to another.
To his moderation in regard to Harald his colleague
and Sweyn of Denmark we have done justice;
but if Snorro is to be credited, he showed no less towards
our Edward the Confessor. That he was not
without ambition is evident; and as the heir of the
Danish throne, by his compact with Harda-Canute, king
of England and Denmark, he claimed, after that monarch’s
death, all the states of the great Canute. Edward
returned a spirited reply, the justice of which he
acknowledged by his inactivity.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1047 to 1064.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>By the death of Magnus the Good, <span class='sc'>Harald Hardrade</span>
was the undisputed king of Norway. He aspired
also to the throne of Denmark, from which he
endeavoured to unseat his former ally Sweyn. His
desultory operations and his decisive victory over the
Dane, in 1062, we have before related. Two years
afterwards peace was made, no permanent advantage
having been gained by either.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1066.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>On the death of Edward the Confessor, and the accession
of Harald the son of earl Godwin, the Norwegian
monarch led an armament against that usurper. The
ambition which could prompt him to such an undertaking
was not very measured; but it was characteristic
of this king, whose early familiarity with danger, and
whose wild adventures in the East and North, had
rendered him confident of success. If the English were
not favourable to earl Godwin’s son, they could scarcely
be so to <i>him</i>; and the hope of conquest, when so valiant
a competitor as William of Normandy was entering
the field, would have appeared futile to any less
desperate man. The result is known to every reader of
English history: at Stamford-Bridge Harald found a
grave.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1066 to 1069.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>From the fatal shores of England <span class='sc'>Olaf III.</span>, the son
of Harald, returned to Norway, and with his brother
<span class='sc'>Magnus II.</span> was elected to the government. The
former had the eastern, the latter the northern, provinces
of the kingdom. In three years Magnus paid the common
debt, and Olaf became monarch of the whole.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1069 to 1093.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The reign of Olaf was pacific; and he applied his
efforts to the civilisation of his kingdom. He first
introduced chimneys and glass windows into houses:
he established a commercial emporium at Bergen; and
to him we must ascribe the introduction of guilds or
mercantile fraternities, after the model of those existing
in Germany and England. He must be praised, too,
for his humanity to the servile class: he carried in the
national Thing a law that in every district throughout
Norway a serf should be annually enfranchised. To
the church he was a munificent patron. At Nidaros,
or Drontheim, he began to build a stone cathedral,
destined to receive the hallowed relics of his ancestor.
“This city,” says Adam of Bremen, the contemporary
of Olaf the Pacific, “is the capital of the
Northmen. It is adorned with churches, and frequented
by a great concourse of people. Here lies the body of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>the holy king and martyr Olaf, at whose tomb miracles
are daily wrought: here, from the most distant nations,
pilgrims flock to his shrine to share in his blessed
merits. Hitherto there are no fixed limits to the dioceses
in Norway and Sweden. Any bishop, when desired
by the king and people, may build a church in
any district, and govern those whom he converts to the
day of his death.” These regionary bishops, as they
are called, moved from place to place, baptising and
preaching as they went along; and assuredly this is a
more useful, a more apostolic practice than that which
has since prevailed.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1093 to 1095.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><a id='MagnusIII'></a><span class='sc'>Magnus III.</span>, surnamed <i>Barfoet</i>, or the Barefoot,
succeeded his father Olaf III. At first, he was
acknowledged by the southern provinces: in the
northern was opposed to him Hako, nephew of the
late king. Though death soon rid him of that rival,
an army only could induce those provinces to receive
him.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1096 to 1099.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>This was the first Norwegian monarch after St. Olaf
that visited the Orkneys. He went to punish the
jarls of those islands, which had thrown off their allegiance
to the yoke of Norway. These jarls were
Erling and Paul, whom he took and sent prisoners to his
kingdom. Leaving his son Sigurd in the government,
with fit councillors, he laid waste Sutherland, which
was a portion of the jarldom, and feudally dependent on
the Scotch crown. Proceeding to the Hebrides, he
reduced them also. Very different was his conduct at
Iona from that which had been pursued by his pagan
ancestors. He showed great veneration for the memory
of S. Columbe, and great affability to the inhabitants
of all the islands that submitted. Ilay was next reduced,
then Cantyre. These successes were followed
by predatory depredations on both the Irish and Scottish
coasts. Most places offered little resistance, but the conquest
of Anglesey could not be effected without a battle.
Two Welsh chieftains, both named <i>Hugh</i>, fought stoutly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>for their independence. One, Hugh the Magnanimous,
was so encased in armour, that his two eyes only were
visible: Magnus shot an arrow into one eye, and a
Norwegian warrior into another; and after a valiant
struggle victory declared for the Northmen. The
whole island, we are told, acknowledged the king; but
this statement will obtain little credit with any reader.
The truth seems to be that he made some of the chiefs
do homage for their respective domains; but they reasserted
their independence the moment he had left
the shores. There is more probability in another statement
of the northern chroniclers, that he forced Malcolm
of Scotland to cede to him the sovereignty over
all the islands, from the Orkneys to Man. From this
expedition he returned in 1099. Its results were valuable:
the Hebrides and the Orkneys were now his.
The possession of the former indeed was short-lived
and precarious; but the latter were long subject to his
successors.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1099 to 1101.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The next war of this restless prince was with his
neighbour Inge, king of Sweden. It arose from a
dispute as to the boundary, and raged for two years
with varied success until, through the mediation of
Eric king of Denmark, peace was restored. On this occasion,
Magnus married the princess Margaret, daughter
of Inge.</p>

<p class='c024'>Within a year from this pacification, Magnus, whose
enterprise was excited by his late successes, again sailed
for Ireland, with the design of subjugating, if not the
native kings, those who were of Scandinavian origin.
At this period, the island contained several of these
principalities. Landing on the coast of Connaught, the
king of which, Murdoch, was his acquaintance and
ally, he effected a junction with that chief, and subdued
the kingdom of Dublin. The following winter he
spent in Connaught; and when spring arrived, he embarked
to return. As he slowly passed along the
Ulster coast, he sent a party of his followers in search
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>of provisions, that is, of plunder. Their stay being
much longer than he had expected, he landed with a
small body, and with difficulty made his way through
the marshes. Being at length joined by the foragers,
he was returning to his ships, when he fell into an
ambush prepared for him by the natives. He was easily
known by his shining helmet and breastplate, and
by the golden lion on the red shield—the device of the
Norwegian kings. Ordering one of his chiefs with a
body of archers to clear the marsh, and from the other
side to gall the enemy with their arrows, so as to cover
his passage also, he fought with desperation. Unfortunately,
the chief on whom he thus relied fled, and was
followed by the rest. Magnus, therefore, with a mere
handful of men, had to sustain the hostile assaults of a
multitude. All that valour could do was effected by him;
but the contest was too unequal; and, after receiving
several wounds, he fell. His followers retreated, leaving
his corpse in the hands of the enemy. Thus perished
a monarch whose valour and constancy rendered him
equal to the ancient heroes of the North. By the
warlike he was beloved; but with the people at large,
whom he taxed heavily to defray the expenses of his
frequent expeditions, he was no favourite. His character
may be best conceived from the reply which he
gave to his courtiers, who expressed their apprehension
lest his continued wars should prove fatal to him:—“It
is better for a people to have a brave than an old
king.”</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1103.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>On the death of Magnus III., Norway was divided
between his three sons. <span class='sc'>Sigurd</span> had the southern
provinces, with the Scottish islands, which he governed
by his jarls. <span class='sc'>Eystein I.</span> reigned over the North.
<span class='sc'>Olaf IV.</span> had the central and eastern provinces. All
were children at their accession: the eldest, Eystein, was
but fifteen; and Olaf was so young that for some
years his portion of the monarchy was administered
by his elder brothers.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1103 to 1122.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Of these kings, two may be dismissed with little
notice. Eystein was distinguished for prudence, and
for the useful structures with which he adorned his
portion of the kingdom. He erected stone churches and
palaces, which were novelties in the North. He was
well versed in history and the laws, and was the patron
of literary men, especially of the Scalds. Olaf was the
best beloved of the three; but he died in 1116, and
his dominions were divided by his brothers. Eystein
was never at open war with Sigurd; but the two
brothers could scarcely be warm friends; and while we
read of their disputes, we are surprised that there should
have existed so much tranquillity in the realm. In
1122 he breathed his last, and Sigurd was monarch of
Norway.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1107 to 1111.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The name of Sigurd I. is celebrated in the annals of
the North alike for his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and his
exploits during the voyage. To aid in the recovery of
the holy places from the hands of the infidels might
enrich an adventurous monarch, and would surely open
to him the gates of heaven. Influenced by this two-fold
advantage, and by the hope of booty on the passage,
Sigurd, with sixty ships, sailed from the North. During
the first winter he remained in England, and was
hospitably entertained by our Henry I. The second
winter, at least the greater part of it, he passed near
the shrine of Santiago in Gallicia: he was a pilgrim,
no less than a champion of the cross. On his way to
Lisbon, he captured some infidel privateers, and destroyed
several Moorish settlements on the coast, especially
one at Cintra. All who refused baptism he
put to the sword. Lisbon, according to the Northern
chroniclers, was divided into two parts, one inhabited
by the Moors, the other by the Christians.
The former he assailed, took it, and with much booty
proceeded through the straits of Gibraltar in quest of
new adventures. Having passed these straits, he conquered
a whole fleet of the infidels, and this was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>fifth battle since he left Norway. In vain did the
Mohammedan pirates on the African coast resist him:
his valour overcame every thing. Landing in Sicily, he
was magnificently entertained by Roger, sovereign of the
island, who had expelled the Saracens. Roger was of
Norman descent: he remembered the land of his sires;
and so far did he carry his goodwill as to insist on
serving Sigurd at table. Continuing his voyage, he
landed at Acre, and proceeded to Jerusalem, where the
offer of his sword was most welcome to Baldwin. From
that king he received what he thought a valuable treasure—a
fragment of the true cross, which he promised to
deposit in the shrine of St. Olaf. He promised too, at
the instance of his new friends, to establish an archiepiscopal
see in Norway, to build churches, and to enforce
the payment of tithe. His last exploit in these
regions was to join in the siege of Sidon; and when that
city was taken, half the booty became his. On his return
through Constantinople, his reception by the Greek
emperor was a noble one; but much of what the
Northern annalists relate bears the marks of invention.
Such are, the opening of the golden gate; the carpetting
of the streets; the three large presents made
him by Alexis, with their immediate distribution among
the followers of Sigurd; and the gift by the latter of
his sixty ships to Alexis. Such fables may gratify a
Northern imagination; but history can only say that
in 1111, the king arrived in Norway after an absence
of four years.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1111 to 1123.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>That this remarkable expedition redounded greatly to
the honour of Sigurd, is certain: he was thenceforth
much venerated throughout the North. He married,
and attended to the duties of government, especially to
the extirpation of idolatry. His expedition (undertaken
at the request of the Danish king) against the inhabitants
of the isle of Smaland, was one congenial to his
feelings. They had received Christianity, but, like
many other portions of the Scandinavian population,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>had returned to idolatry. Even Sweden had its pagans
and apostates, some too of royal dignity.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c023'><sup>[164]</sup></a> Great was
the punishment inflicted by Sigurd and his ally Nicholas
on the pagans whom they had vanquished;
but mercy to infidels, and still less to apostates, formed
no portion of their creed.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1124 to 1130.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>In his latter days, Sigurd seems to have occasionally
lost the use of his reason, or perhaps he was visited by
some bodily infirmity which gave him the appearance
of insanity. But he never relinquished the duties of
royalty. One of his last cares was to fortify Konghella
on the river Gotha, to ornament it with a fine
Gothic church, and to place in that sacred edifice some
of the pictures which he had brought from the East.
But with all his attachment to the church, he was not
without his delinquencies. Of these one of the most
noted was his dismissal of his queen to make room for
a concubine, Cecilia by name, whom he resolved to
marry. A great entertainment was provided for the
occasion, and many were the guests assembled at Bergen.
The bishop of the district, hearing of the intention,
hastened to the town, and expostulated with the king
on the guilt of dismissing one wife to take another,
when there was no charge against the former, and consequently
no way of annulling the marriage. Great
was the wrath of Sigurd, who held a drawn sword in
his hand, and who, at one moment, seemed disposed to
use it on the neck of the prelate. If he so far restrained
his passion as to walk away, he persevered
in his design, and the union was celebrated. The
truth is, that his heart was so fixed on the maiden, that
no earthly consideration could induce him to abandon
her. Some time afterwards he was afflicted with
his last illness, which was regarded by many as the
judgment of Heaven on his crime. His courtiers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>urged him to dismiss her; and she, out of regard for
him—to save him from renewed guilt—really wished
to leave him. Such was the attachment he bore her,
that he could not give his consent to the separation.
She departed, however, and with her departed the only
solace which had been left him. In a few days he was
no more. Previously to his death, he had caused his
son Magnus to be recognised as his successor, and
had prevailed on the states to swear that they would
obey him.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1130.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>From the death of Sigurd I. to the union of Norway
with Denmark, there is little in the history of the
former country to interest us. During the whole of
the twelfth century we perceive nothing but anarchy
and bloodshed occasioned by disputes for the throne.
In a country where illegitimacy was no bar to the
succession, and where partition of the sovereign power
was frequent, there could not fail to be numerous candidates.
Sigurd I. was succeeded by his son <span class='sc'>Magnus
IV.</span>, to whom, as we have related, the states of
the realm had sworn fealty before the death of Sigurd.
How little dependence could be placed on such a
guarantee soon appeared. In the reign of the preceding
monarch, an adventurer, Harald Gille, had
asserted—probably with justice—that he was a natural
son of king Magnus Barefoot. As he could produce
no satisfactory proof of that connection, recourse
was had to the decision of Heaven, and he was made to
pass over nine red-hot ploughshares. This ordeal,
merely to prove his parentage, was thought to be severe;
but he shrinked not from it; and led by two
bishops, he sustained it unhurt. To resist the divine
pleasure was impossible, and Harald’s claim was allowed
even by Sigurd, on the condition that he would not insist
on the advantage to which his relationship entitled him,
before the death of his son Magnus IV. Scarcely,
however, had this Magnus succeeded to the throne,
than Harald came forward to assert his right; and
from the number no less than the influence of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>who espoused his interests (among them were the kings
of Denmark and Sweden), he had every thing to hope
from a civil war. In this emergency, Magnus consented
to a division of the kingdom, the very year of his
accession.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1130 to 1152.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1134.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1136.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Harald IV.</span> was very different in character and
manners from his colleague Magnus. He was mild
as the latter was severe, and generous as the latter was
penurious. He therefore became the favourite of the
people. This circumstance probably roused the jealousy
of Magnus, who at the head of many followers marched
against him, conquered him, and compelled him to
forsake the realm. Repairing to the court of Eric
Emund, king of Denmark, he was well received by
that monarch, “because they were brothers in arms.”
With the supply of money and men furnished him by
his generous host, he returned to Denmark, and surprised
rather than defeated Magnus, whom he consigned
to a monastery and deprived of eye-sight. He was now
therefore monarch of Norway. But his reign was of
short duration. The town of Konghella which Sigurd
had fortified, and adorned with so magnificent a church,
was taken by the Slavonic pirates: it was completely
sacked, and the inhabitants led into captivity. For this
disaster, Harald was censured: he was accused of inactivity
in repelling the invaders; and was even forsaken
by the great body of his supporters. In this
condition he was assassinated. A melancholy illustration
of the spirit of the times is afforded by the
fact that the assassin, Sigurd, also claimed Magnus
Barefoot for his father. From this deed of blood
he derived no advantage. The nation would not admit
<i>his</i> claim, but proclaimed two sons of the murdered
king, <span class='sc'>Sigurd II.</span> (1136–1155) and <span class='sc'>Inge I.</span>
(1136–1161). Both, however, were children; and
their inability to defend themselves led to civil war.
Sigurd, their reputed uncle, the assassin of their father,
raised troops and laid waste the country. To strengthen
his party he formed an alliance with Magnus the Blind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>whom he drew from the monastery; but he was defeated
and compelled to flee. Both soon obtained the
aid of the Danish king Eric; but fortune was still unfavourable:
in battle, Magnus lost his life; and the
restless Sigurd too was made prisoner, and subsequently
executed. Though two enemies were thus removed, the
royal brothers, Sigurd and Inge, were often at discord;
and a third firebrand was soon added in <span class='sc'>Eystein II.</span>
(1142–1157), a younger brother, who, returning
from Scotland in 1142, was invested with a third portion
of the realm. There was not, nor could there be,
any tranquillity in the country. Complaints, recriminations,
quarrels, treachery, bloodshed, succeeded each
other, when the arrival of a papal legate, the cardinal
Albano, suspended for a time the sanguinary proceedings
of these princes.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1152.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>This legate was Nicholas Breakspear, our countryman,
who subsequently ascended the pontifical throne
as Adrian IV. His mission was two-fold—to restore
peace between the unnatural brothers, and to establish
an archbishopric. The Norwegian monarchs had long
demanded a primate of their own, instead of being
dependent on the archbishops of Lund. In both
objects he was successful. The three kings laid down
their arms; united in showing the highest deference to
the legate; and beheld with joy the creation of a metropolitan
see at Trondheim, with a jurisdiction, not over
Norway merely, but Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe
islands, the Shetlands, the Orkneys, the Hebrides, and
Man. In return, the chiefs and people readily agreed
to pay the tribute of Peter’s Pence. Many were the
reforms which this well-meaning dignitary endeavoured
to carry. He introduced more decorum into the public
worship; he enjoined the clergy to attend more to their
proper functions, and to interfere less in secular matters;
and impressed on the new archbishop the necessity
of a rigorous control over the morals of his flock.
In attempting to enforce clerical celibacy, he did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>meet with so ready an acquiescence; but no one dared
openly to resist him. To another of his measures we
must award a much higher meed of praise. Seeing
that bloodshed had for many reigns stained the proceedings
of the Lands-Thing, or provincial assembly,
he prevailed on the chiefs to promise that they would
not in future attend with arms. Even the king was
only to be accompanied by twelve armed men—an
exception conceded less to his dignity than to the necessity
under which he lay of enforcing the judicial sentences.
To an Englishman the conduct of cardinal
Albano on this mission is gratifying. It was no less
esteemed by the Norwegians. “In several other
respects,” observes Snorro, “he reformed the customs
and manners of the people during his stay; so that
never did stranger come to the land more honoured or
more beloved by the princes and their subjects.”</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1153 to 1161.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>If the ascendancy of the cardinal had restored peace,
his departure was immediately followed by new struggles
between two of the brothers. Eystein had no share in
them, because he absented himself on a piratical expedition.
He is said to have ravaged the eastern coasts
of our island, from the Orkneys to the Humber. Soon
after his return, he entered into a plot with Sigurd to
remove their brother Inge. In 1155, Sigurd and Inge
met in the Thing held at Bergen, and though they
could not fight for want of arms, both they and their
followers regarded one another with deadly hatred.
Scarcely was the assembly dissolved, when Inge, who
had heard of the plot for removing him, determined to
prevent it by assailing Sigurd, and after a sharp contest
the latter fell. The following year Inge and Eystein,
who were still hostile, met to agree on conditions
of peace; but it was a truce rather than a peace, and in
a few months it was broken by both parties. They
marched towards each other with the resolution of deciding
their quarrel by the sword; but Eystein, who
was unpopular, was deserted by most of his followers,
and compelled to seek an asylum in the mountains of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Vikia. Thither he was pursued by Inge, was betrayed
in a forest, and put to death by one of his brother’s
myrmidons. By this deed therefore Inge was the
monarch of the country. But he had soon a competitor
in <span class='sc'>Hako III.</span>, son of Sigurd II., whom the party of
Eystein proclaimed king (1157). The four succeeding
years were years of civil war. Hako, a mere child, was
driven into Gothland. The following season he returned
and besieged Konghella; but he was again defeated
and forced to re-enter Sweden. Yet early in
1159 he arrived at Drontheim, where he found adherents.
With thirty vessels he laid waste the coasts which
held for Inge; but in a great naval battle he was defeated
by that king, though not without considerable
loss to the victor. Repairing into Drontheim where
he passed the winter, he prepared for the next campaign.
It was not decisive; but, in 1161, Inge, betrayed
by his own followers, fell in battle with Hako.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1161 to 1164.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>By this event, Hako, it might be expected, would be
left undisputed sovereign of Norway. But the Norwegians
at this period seem to have had little wish for
a monarchy; and <span class='sc'>Magnus V.</span> (1162–1186) was raised
by the party of the deceased Inge to the throne of the
North. Magnus was the grandson of Sigurd I., and one
of his duties in the opinion of the times was to revenge
the murder of his kindred. As, however, he was but a
child, the government was administered by his father
Erling. Erling was, by marriage, a kinsman of the
Danish monarch, from whom he obtained aid to resist
the hostility of Hako. Through that aid he was
victor; Hako fell (1162), and consequently Magnus
was the only king left. A rival indeed, Sigurd, a son
of Sigurd II., was opposed to him; but in little more
than a year that rival was crushed by the indefatigable
Erling. To confirm the authority of his son by religious
sanction, Erling requested the primate to crown
him. The archbishop consented on the condition that
Norway should be regarded as a fief of St. Olaf; that
on the death of every monarch, the crown was to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>formally offered to the saint in the cathedral; that the
saint’s representative, the archbishop of the time, should
receive it; that from each diocese the bishop, the abbots,
and twelve chiefs, should assemble to nominate a
successor, and that the sanction of the primate should
be necessary before any one could be lawful king of
Norway. That a considerable reduction in the number
of electors was politic cannot be disputed; and probably
this was one of the reasons that induced the archbishop
to introduce so extraordinary an innovation. But a
greater no doubt was the superiority which the church
would thereby acquire over the state. The proposal
was accepted; and Magnus, then only eight years of
age, was solemnly crowned by Eystein in presence of
the papal legate.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1164 to 1170.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The aid furnished by the Danish king was not gratuitous.
In return for it Erling had promised the
province of Vikia (Vigen), and Valdemar (the first of that
name) now demanded the fulfilment of that pledge.
His position was a critical one. He had not power to
transfer that province, and if he attempted that transfer,
his own destruction and that of his son must be the result.
Yet if he did nothing, he must expect an encounter
with that formidable monarch. To escape from this
dilemma, he convoked the states, and laid before them
the proposition of Valdemar: they indignantly refused
to receive the Danish yoke. Open war followed, but
through the policy of Erling it was soon succeeded by
peace. He secretly engaged to hold Vikia with the title
of jarl as a fief of Denmark; and, in the event of a
failure of issue in his son, to subject the whole kingdom
to the same crown.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1166 to 1169.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Neither the sanction of the church, nor the vigour of
his father, nor even his own virtues, could except Magnus
from the common lot of Norwegian kings—open rebellion
and rivalry for the throne. The next who troubled
his tranquillity was Olaf, a grandson of Eystein II.
Proclaimed king by the Uplanders, Olaf had the glory
to defeat the regent; but in his turn he was defeated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>and compelled to flee into Denmark, where he died the
following year (1169).</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1173 to 1177.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The next was a more formidable rival, in the person
of Eystein, a prince of the same family. Placing himself
at the head of the discontented, the banished, the
proscribed, this prince became a bandit chief, and laid
waste the provinces on the borders of Sweden. As the
number of his followers increased, so did his boldness,
until with a small fleet he sailed for Nidaros, which he
subdued. Here he persuaded or forced the people to
elect him king (1176). The following year he penetrated
into the central provinces, which had the option
of either doing homage, or of experiencing all the evils
of desolation. In 1177, four years after the commencement
of his adventurous career, he met Magnus in the
field, and was defeated. His followers hastened into
Sweden, the eastern provinces of which were still pagan,
and but loosely connected with the crown. He was less
fortunate: he was slain in his flight.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1174 to 1178.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Of a different character from either of the preceding,
and more successful in his object, was the next adventurer,
Swerro, whose career is one of romance. His
mother, Alfhilda, had been the concubine of Sigurd II.;
and he was the issue of the connection. After Sigurd’s
death, she became the wife of a smith—a business of
high repute in the North—and removed, with her husband
and son, to the Faroe isles. Young Swerro was
designed for the church, and on reaching the age of
twenty-five, he entered into holy orders. Now, for
the first time, his mother acquainted him with the secret
of his birth. Far more wisely would she have acted
by keeping it in her own bosom; for no sooner did
the young priest know it, than he indulged in dreams
of ambition. As our sleeping are but the images of
our waking thoughts, he had a dream which seemed to
prognosticate his future greatness. He mentioned it to
a friend, who promised him the archbishopric of Drontheim.
But he had no relish for the ecclesiastical state;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>and he mentally interpreted it in a different way. Urged
by ambition, he left the obscure isles in which he had been
so long imprisoned, and repaired to the court of Magnus.
His learning and his martial appearance made a favourable
impression on the regent Erling; and he too so
admired the vigorous administration of that chief, that
in despair of effecting a revolution, he withdrew into
the Swedish province of Wermeland. Probably his
design was to subsist by plunder, in the service of one
of those predatory bands, so frequent on the confines of
the two kingdoms. At first, however, his prospects
were gloomy; and in his restlessness, he had resolved
to go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, when the band
which Eystein had commanded solicited him to become
their chief. After some hesitation he consented, was
invested with the royal title, and enabled to take the
field.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1178 to 1186.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The early efforts of this adventurer were bold but
unsuccessful. In an expedition through the southern
provinces he was indeed joined by some hundred of followers,
mostly bandits; but when he proceeded towards
the north, where Magnus and Erling had their
seat of government, he was abandoned by most of his
adherents: the enterprise was too desperate even for
them. With great difficulty did he save himself by
penetrating through the mountain passes into Wermeland.
To escape the pursuits of his enemies, no less
than to recruit his numbers, the following spring he
plunged into the vast forests of the modern Delecarlia,
then called Jarnberaland, or the Iron-being land. The
inhabitants knew little of Swedish kings, or of the rest
of the world, or of Christianity; but they knew the
value of freedom; and in the apprehension that he came
to deprive them of it, they prepared a stout resistance.
He had no difficulty, however, in persuading those sons
of the forest, the mountain, and the river, that he had
no design against them—that he wanted hospitality,
guides, and troops. Of the last he seems to have obtained
none; but he was well entertained, and conducted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>into Jamtland, where his little band was recruited. The
hardships which he underwent in this expedition,—cold,
hunger, fatigue—made him resolve to attempt
some enterprise, the success of which would rescue him
from this wretched mode of life. Appearing suddenly
before Drontheim, he hoped to surprise the place; but
he was repulsed, and again forced to seek a refuge in the
mountains. His next object was to increase the number
of his followers; and as he, or some about him, were
well acquainted with the haunts of the banditti in the
trackless forest, and the inaccessible cavern, he obtained
a considerable accession. But a hardy band of peasant
archers from Tellmark was his most valuable acquisition.
Reappearing before the gates of the capital, he
defeated the little army of Magnus, and captured the
banner of St. Olaf. As both king and regent were at
Bergen, their usual place of residence, he pushed his
way into the city, assembled the inhabitants of the province,
and was proclaimed king! His task, however,
was not half accomplished. A numerous party, including
all the churchmen, adhered to Magnus; and he
was soon expelled from Drontheim, to seek a shelter in
his mountain fastnesses. But with these revolutions he
was now familiar: he knew how to recruit his forces—to
advance when there was a prospect of victory—retreat
when the danger was evident. During two years
the civil war raged with violence, and the alternations
of triumph and defeat succeeded each other with rapidity.
At length Swerro suddenly descended from the
mountains, and defeated the regent and his son, leaving
the former dead on the field. Magnus fled, but only to
return with another army. The second battle, however,
was not more fortunate than the first; his army was
annihilated or dispersed; and he was glad to seek a refuge
in Denmark, while the archbishop fled to England.
By the Danish monarch Magnus was supplied with an
armament, with which he again contended for the throne,
but with no better success. A second time he repaired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>to that country for aid, and again he fought with the
usurper. As on the two former occasions, victory declared
for Swerro: his rival fled, and perished in the
waves. He was not one of those savage chieftains
in whom ancient Norway rejoiced, and whom some of
her modern sons would have us mention with respect.
If his soul had not been much improved by religion,
it had been humanised by education. To the followers
of Magnus he exhibited great clemency. He caused the
fallen monarch to be magnificently interred in the cathedral
of Drontheim; and he himself, in conformity with
ancient custom, pronounced the funeral oration of the
deceased, to whose virtues, now that he had no reason to
fear them, he paid the sincere homage of praise.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1186 to 1194.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Swerro</span> (1186–1202) thus obtained the object of
his ambition; but he could not expect to hold it in
peace. In fact, the whole of his reign was a struggle
to preserve what he had so painfully gained. From
England archbishop Eystein hurled the thunders of the
church at the head of the apostate priest; but the promise
of the king, that he would lay his case before the
pope, and submit to such penance as his holiness might
impose, induced the primate to return and resume his
metropolitan functions. Much of his attention was
employed on the enlargement and improvement of his
cathedral, which he wished to vie with the most splendid
Gothic edifices in Europe. From the king he derived
considerable aid towards this end; but he lived only to
finish the choir. The rest was completed by archbishop
Sigurd, in 1248. It was then a very respectable structure.
The high altar, which was adorned with a costly
silver shrine containing the relics of St. Olaf, and which
was visited by pilgrims from all parts of the North, had
a splendid appearance. Swerro no doubt expected that
by his liberality on this occasion he should win over to
his government the great body of the clergy; but he
refused to hold the crown as a feudatory of St. Olaf, that
is, of the primate; and this rebellion cancelled all his
other merits. Aware of the influence which the primate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>exercised over the people, he endeavoured, on the death
of Eystein, to obtain the election of a successor favourable
to his views; but in defiance of his influence, that
successor was one of his enemies, Eric bishop of Stavenger,
who had been the warm friend of Erling and
Magnus. From the hands of the new primate he solicited
the ceremony of the coronation; but Eric refused,
and for so doing he has been severely censured. It
should, however, be remembered, that he could not crown
an excommunicated prince. That penalty Swerro had
incurred by various crimes—by forsaking the altar without
the leave of his diocesan, by the shedding of blood
at the head of banditti, by assuming the crown without
secularisation, and by taking a wife. No bishop, no
metropolitan could absolve him: the pope only was
competent to dispense with the authority of the canons.
In revenge for this refusal, Swerro, a man of vigorous
mind, and without a particle of superstition, endeavoured
to curtail the revenues and patronage of the
church. He insisted that its claim to the pecuniary
fine in case of homicide should be abolished, and
that the fine should revert to the crown. For this act
he must command our praise; but we cannot praise him
for attempting to usurp the patronage of the church.
We have scarcely an instance in all history of a king
exercising the trust in an enlightened and a conscientious
manner. Eric supported with firmness the
rights of the church, and by so doing incurred the royal
displeasure to such a degree that he was compelled to
flee into Denmark. From thence he appealed to the
pope, who threatened to place the kingdom under an
interdict, unless satisfaction were made to the church.
In vain did Swerro endeavour to prove that the pope
had no right to interfere in such cases: the canons, he
well knew, taught a different doctrine. In vain did he
attempt to make the multitude believe that the blindness
with which the archbishop was visited during the dispute
was owing to the wrath of heaven. The people
had more confidence in the primate and in the pope,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>than they had in a monarch whose early career had not
been the most edifying.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1194 to 1200.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Convinced by experience how little was to be gained
by struggling with the formidable power which humbled
the greatest monarchs, Swerro now applied to the
pope for absolution and pardon. He was directed, in
the first instance, to make his peace with the archbishop,
who alone could intercede for him. Incensed at the
reply, and fearful lest the people should desert him because
he had not been crowned, he convoked his bishops,
and prevailed on one of them—a mere court tool—to
perform the ceremony. To anoint an apostate
priest would not have been within the bounds even
of papal authority: penance and absolution were previously
indispensable; but neither were exacted, and
if they had been, the censure could only have been removed
by the supreme pontiff. The bishop who performed
a ceremony in its very nature null was excommunicated;
and the king’s own excommunication was
confirmed. In this emergency, Swerro convoked an Al-Thing
at Bergen, where a resolution was passed to send
deputies to Rome to procure his absolution. On their
return they all died in Denmark—no doubt through
poison. They brought no absolution; but a confirmation
of the former sentence. For this instrument the
king, who was capable of any act, substituted another,
which contained a plenary remission, and which he
declared was the one brought from the head of the
church. To account for the death of his messengers,
he asserted that they had been poisoned by his enemies
lest the papal absolution should reach him. The benefits
of this deception he could not long hope to enjoy.
Alexander III. charged him with both the forgery and
the murder, and placed the whole kingdom under an
interdict. Even the bishop, Nicholas, who had crowned
him now escaped into Denmark, to join the metropolitan;
and both were nobly entertained by archbishop
Absalom, primate and minister of that kingdom.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1194 to 1202.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>During these transactions with the church, Swerro
was twice compelled to enter the field against claimants
for the crown. The first was Sigurd, son of Magnus V.,
who had taken refuge in the Orkneys. Accompanied
by a band of adventurers, Sigurd landed in Norway,
and was joined by many of the peasantry. But Swerro
had a body of men whose valour was unequalled, and
whose fidelity was above all suspicion—men whom he
had commanded before his accession, to whom he was
indebted for the throne, and whom he had transferred
from robbers into good soldiers. With them he triumphed
over Sigurd, whose corpse rested on the field.
The next adventurer was supported by bishop Nicholas,
who was anxious to ingratiate himself with his metropolitan
and the pope, by exhibiting uncommon zeal in
the destruction of the king. His name was Inge, and he
was represented by his patron as a son of that same
Magnus. When he and the bishop landed, they were
joined by a considerable number of the discontented;
but the king, who had obtained archers from England,
was better prepared than even on the former occasion
to defend his authority. Still the struggle was a desperate
one; several battles were fought, and two or
three victories were necessary to humble the hopes of
the assailants.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1202.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>In the midst of these struggles, after a whole life
past in fomenting rebellion or crushing it, Swerro
breathed his last at the age of fifty-one. That he was
a man of great genius and of commanding character
is evident from his unparalleled success. Whether he
was really the son of a Norwegian king is extremely
doubtful; but even if he were, he had none of the advantages
which the relationship generally ensures. His
fortune was the result of his own enterprising powers.
Few indeed are the characters in history who have
risen from so obscure to so high a station against obstacles
so great; fewer still who, in the midst of perpetual
dangers, have been able to maintain themselves
in that station. In both respects he is almost unequalled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>On the whole, he may safely be pronounced
one of the most extraordinary men of the middle ages.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1202 to 1204.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Before the death of his father, <span class='sc'>Hako III.</span> (1202–1204)
had been saluted as heir of the monarchy; and
he ascended the throne without opposition. One of his
first acts was to recal the primate, the rest of the
bishops, and all whom his father had exiled. In return
the interdict was removed from the realm; and prosperity
was returning to a country so long harassed by
civil wars when the young king died—not without
suspicion of poison from the hands of his stepmother,
Margaret, a daughter of St. Eric, king of Sweden. There
seems, however, to be no foundation for the suspicion;
and indeed what could she gain by the crime?</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1204 to 1207.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Guthrum</span> (1204–1205), a grandson of Swerro,
was next raised to the throne; but his reign was only
a year, and there seems to be little doubt that he was
removed by poison, through the contrivance of a faction
which hoped to restore the ancient line of kings.
In consequence of this event, <span class='sc'>Inge II.</span> (1205–1207), a
grandson on the female side of Sigurd II., acceded; but
in two years he too descended to the tomb—whether
violently or in the order of nature is unknown. The
death of four princes in five years is a melancholy illustration
of the times.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1207.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>There now remained only one male descendant of this
dynasty—Hako, a natural son of Swerro. After his
father’s death, and during the struggles between the old
and the new dynasty for the supreme power, this prince
was secreted in the mountains. Fortunately for him,
the companions of his father, the devoted Birkibeinar,
the bandit soldiers, still remained: they espoused his
cause, and procured his election to the throne. Before
the church, however, would ratify the election, the
mother, Inga, was required to undergo the ordeal of
hot-iron, in proof of her having truly sworn to the
paternity of her son. She consented; was shut up in
a church to prepare by fasting and prayer for the trial;
was guarded night and day by twelve armed men;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>and the burning-iron left no wound on her fair hand.
Whoever doubted that the ordeal was a fair one, that
Hako was the offspring of Swerro, was menaced with
excommunication.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1208 to 1241.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Hako IV.</span> was thus the recognised monarch of the
country; but he had still to sustain the hostility of the
faction which adhered to the former dynasty. The
most inveterate as well as the most powerful of his enemies
was Skule the jarl, half-brother of Inge II. To
pacify this ambitious noble, he was admitted to a share
in the government; and his daughter became a wife of
Hako. This union, in effecting which the church had
a great share, was expected to combine the hearts of both
factions. But the hope was vain: other pretenders to
the legitimate or illegitimate honour of royal descent
appeared in succession to claim a portion of their
birthright. So distracted was the country by these
conflicting claims, that a great council of the nation
was convoked at Bergen. The decision was, that Hako
was the only lawful king. Yet through the advice of
the primate, whose object was evidently to avert a civil
war, the northern provinces were confided to Skule;
and by the king he was soon adorned with the ducal
title—a title which had been in disuse ever since the
ninth century. But this ambitious noble was not to be
silenced by benefits. On a memorable day (1240) he
convoked the states of his own government to assemble
in the cathedral: his descent from the martyr Olaf was
then attested by oath on the relics of that saint; and
by his party, amidst the silence of the spectators, he was
declared the lawful heir to the crown, as the successor
of Inge II. Constrained by the example, the rest did
homage to him after he had sworn to administer the
laws in righteousness, as his holy predecessor had administered
them. Thus the northern provinces were
again dissevered from the monarchy. But Hako was
true to his own rights and the interests of his people.
Assembling his faithful Birkibeinar, and all who valued
the interests of his order, he marched towards Drontheim.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>At his approach, the usurper fled into the interior,
but only to collect new forces, with which he
obtained some advantages over those of Hako. When
spring returned, however, and the latter marched
against the rebels, fortune declared for him. Skule was
signally defeated, compelled to flee, overtaken, and
killed.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1242 to 1260.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Released from the scourge of civil war, Hako now
applied his attention to the internal government of his
kingdom. He made new treaties of commerce with
the neighbouring powers: he fortified his sea-ports;
he improved the laws; he made salutary changes in the
local administration. But he was not yet fully at
peace with the church; and he requested Innocent IV.
to mediate between him and them, and to cause the
crown to be placed on his brow. Innocent dispatched
a legate, the cardinal bishop of Sabina, for this purpose.
At first the king was desired to comply with the law
of his predecessor Magnus V.—that Norway should
hereafter be regarded as a fief of St. Olaf: but he had
the patriotism to refuse: he would protect, he observed,
the just rights of the church, but he would never
sanction this usurpation of the ecclesiastical over the
secular state. His firmness was respected, and at the
cardinal’s instance he was crowned without subscribing
to the obnoxious compact. He had gratified that
churchman by promising to go on the crusade; but
though he made preparations circumstances prevented
his departure. His kingdom indeed could not safely
be left at such a crisis. His frontiers were still subject
to ravage from the licentious bands who infested the
western provinces of Sweden, and who took refuge in
either territory when pursued by the injured inhabitants
of the other. Without a cordial union between the
two governments, there could be no hope of extirpating
these predatory bands. Fortunately Birger, the regent
of Sweden, concurred with him in his object. To create
a good understanding between the two countries, a marriage
was negotiated between the daughter of Birger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>whose son was on the throne of Sweden, and Magnus,
the eldest son of Hako. But this union was never
effected: the subsequent conduct of Birger was not
agreeable to the monarch; and Magnus married the
daughter of Christopher, king of Denmark. The clemency
of Hako led to this connection. He had many
causes of complaint against Denmark; and he did not
recur to hostilities until he had long and vainly sued
for redress. He soon reduced Christopher to long for
peace; but with a generosity of which there are few
records among kings, he forgot his wrongs in sympathy
for his brother monarch, and became the friend
of the man whom he had left Norway to chastise.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1263.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The last and by far the most memorable expedition
of Hako was against the Scots. The chief incentive to
this war was the attempt of Alexander III. to recover
the Hebrides, which, as we have before observed<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c023'><sup>[165]</sup></a>, had
been subdued by Magnus Barefoot. Not that they
were then subdued for the first time. The truth is,
that they had frequently been reduced to the Norwegian
yoke as far back as the ninth century, and from that
time had, at intervals, paid tribute to that power.
More frequently, however, they had asserted their independence.
Colonies, too, from the mother-countries,
had assisted to people those islands, which Harald
Harfagre and his successors had regarded as no less a
dependency than the Shetlands or the Orkneys. In the
time of Magnus the number of those colonists increased;
and there were not a few nobles of the isles who could
trace their pedigree to the royal line of Norway. But
their position drew them into the sphere of Scottish
influence: to Scotland, and not to the distant North,
they must look for allies in their frequent wars with
one another; and the eagerness of the Scottish monarchs
to establish their feudal superiority over them
brought the two parties into continual communication.
In 1244, two bishops arrived in Norway to induce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Hako to renounce all claim to the Hebrides. They
told him that he could have no just right to them, since
Magnus Barefoot had only gained possession of them by
violence—by forcibly wresting them from Malcolm
Canmore. The king replied with more truth that
Magnus had not wrested them from the Scottish king,
but from the Norwegian Gudred, who had thrown off
the allegiance due to the mother-country. Defeated in
their historical arguments, they had recourse to one
which with a poor monarch they hoped would be more
convincing—the pecuniary argument. They besought
him to say what sum he would demand for their entire
cession. “I am not so poor that I will sell my birthright!”
was the reply, and the prelates returned.
Alexander III., however, would not abandon the hope
of annexing these islands to his crown; and he commenced
a series of intrigues among the Highland chieftains.
The vassals of Hako began to complain of the
vexatious hostilities to which they were subject, especially
from the thane of Ross, and to beg immediate
aid. The atrocities which they detailed, we should
scarcely expect to find in a Christian people, and in the
thirteenth century: we should rather assign them to
the period when the pagan Northmen ravaged the coasts
of these islands. In great anger Hako convened a diet
at Bergen, and it resolved that the aid required should
be immediately furnished.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1263.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Leaving his son, prince Magnus, regent of the kingdom,
Hako sailed for the Hebrides. In the Orkneys
he was joined by the jarls and by the king of Man. On
the western coast of Scotland, many of the Highland
chieftains submitted to his arms. But though he took
Arran and Bute, and laid waste many of the western
districts of the continent with fire and sword, his expedition
was a disastrous one. At the mouth of the
Clyde, while landing his troops, a tempest arose and
forced him from the shore; and those who were landed
were overpowered by the superior number of the enemy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>In vain did Hako endeavour to lead the rest of his
forces with the view of saving the brave men who were
thus overwhelmed: the storm was too powerful for him;
some of his ships were lost; more were dispersed; and
in great anguish of mind he repaired to the Orkneys
where he intended to winter, and invade Scotland the
ensuing spring. That spring he was never to see.
A fever, the result of anxiety no less than of fatigue,
laid him on the bed from which he was no more to rise.
The activity of his mind, however, was not arrested
even by fatal disease: he caused the Bible and the old
Sagas to be read to him night and day. When convinced
that there was no hope of his recovery, he dictated
his last instructions to his son; made liberal presents
to his followers; confessed and received the sacrament;
and “at midnight Almighty God called him
from this world, to the exceeding grief of all present
and of all who heard of his death.” His body was first
interred in the cathedral of St. Magnus, Kirkwall, but
subsequently removed to Bergen, and laid with those of
his royal ancestors.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1263 to 1266.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Magnus VI.</span> (1263–1280), who had been crowned
during his father’s life, now ascended the throne. He
had the wisdom to make peace with the Scots, by ceding
to them all the islands off their coast except the
Orkneys, but not in full sovereignty. For these he
was to receive 4000 marks, and an annual tribute of
100 marks. At the same time Margaret, the daughter
of Alexander, was betrothed to the son of Magnus.
These islands had never produced any benefit to the
crown: to maintain them would have entailed a ruinous
expenditure of money and blood. But the Orkneys,
though frequently independent, had been so long connected
with the mother-country, and lay so much nearer,
that though their preservation might bring no great advantage,
they were useful as nurseries for seamen. In
the reign of Magnus, too, Iceland became thoroughly
dependent on the Norwegian crown.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1263 to 1280.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Internally, the reign of this prince exhibits considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>improvement. One of his most serious objects,
(which had also been his father’s) was to establish, on
fixed principles, the succession to the throne. As in
other European countries, that succession was now made
to depend on the law of primogeniture, in the male line
only. To this regulation the bishops gave their assent;
and, in accordance with it, they not merely recognised
Eric as the successor of Magnus, but crowned that
prince. Hence they no longer insisted on the obnoxious
compact between Magnus V. and the primate of that
day<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c023'><sup>[166]</sup></a>—a proof that they do not merit all the abuse
which modern history has poured upon them. It is
indeed true that in return for their sanction of this new
and fundamental law of succession, they obtained some
favours; but most of them related to their own
matters. They were excepted, for instance, from the
secular tribunals; but so they were in every other
country in communion with Rome. They refused laymen
to exercise any influence over the election of dignitaries,
and they did right. But when each prelate
claimed the right of coining money, and of maintaining
a body-guard of forty men-at-arms, he surely forgot his
spiritual character, and remembered only that he was
a temporal baron. This reign too witnessed some other
changes. The allodial proprietors became vassals: the
old jarls and hersers were replaced by dukes and barons
and knights; feudal usages were introduced in lieu of
the ancient national customs. As a necessary consequence,
the small landed proprietors, equivalent to the
English yeomen, began to disappear, and to be replaced
by farmers. Still in the national character there was
that which prevented the worse evils of feudality. If the
peasant had no longer a voice, or we should rather say
a vote, in the assembly of the states, except by representation,
he yet continued to be free, and to bear arms. In
the cities and towns of the kingdom there was also a
modification of the old system. In proportion to the
increase of commerce, and to the prosperity of the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>depôts, was that of municipal rights.  These rights
were, as much as possible, assimilated to those of the
German towns. For the two important cities of Bergen
and Drontheim, Magnus himself drew up a code of regulations,
to define the rights of the guilds and of the
different classes of burghers. And for the defence of
the coasts he revived the ancient act of division of the
maritime districts, each of which was to furnish a certain
number of ships, and to maintain its beacon fire, so that
intelligence of an invasion might speedily fly throughout
the country.</p>

<p class='c024'>But the fame of this monarch chiefly rests on his
legislative talents: hence his surname of <i>Lagabeter</i>, or
law-mender. To the code which he compiled from
the centenary observances of the four Norwegian provinces,
and which he designed for general use throughout
his dominions, we shall allude in the proper place.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1280 to 1289.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Eric II.</span>, while yet a minor, succeeded his father
without opposition; but his reign was not one of
peace.  His first disputes were with the church. At
his coronation, he promised rather to amplify than
to curtail its privileges.  In virtue of this promise,
the archbishop of Drontheim drew up a list of offences
against the canon laws, and claimed for the clerical
tribunals the pecuniary mulcts demanded on
such occasions. These mulcts were considered the
right of the crown, and as such were claimed by
royal councillors, on behalf of the king. So far the
conciliations were justifiable; but when they persuaded
him to revoke all the privileges which his father had
conceded, they wantonly perilled the tranquillity of the
kingdom. They were excommunicated by the primate,
who in his turn was banished. Both parties appealed
to Rome; but the pope seems to have been a moderate
man; and, though not disposed to surrender any right
which the church universal possessed, he doubtless saw
that the Norwegian branch of it had usurped some
that were inconsistent with civil government. The
successor of the primate consented to abandon one or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>two of the more obnoxious claims, and to become the
liege vassal of Eric. The king too was embroiled with
Denmark, through the protection which he afforded to
the assassins of Eric Glipping.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c023'><sup>[167]</sup></a> Long and disastrous
was the war which raged between the two countries.
At length, both opened negotiations for peace; but it
was not signed during the life of Eric.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1289 to 1299.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>These disputes with the church and his royal neighbour
prevented Eric from engaging in another war,
for which he might have urged a better reason. In
conformity with the treaty between his father and
Alexander III., he married Margaret of Scotland. The
issue was a female, who, on the death of her grandfather
in 1289 (her mother was no more), was undoubted
heiress to the throne of that kingdom. The
claims of the “Maid of Norway” were urged by her
father; but she had a rival in our Edward I., who had
determined to render the northern ruler his vassal. To
unite the two crowns on the same brow was an object
still more desirable; and in this view the English king
proposed a marriage between his son and the Maid of
Norway. The proposal was readily accepted by Eric;
but before it could be carried into effect, the princess
died in the Orkneys. If Eric exposed himself to ridicule
in claiming the Scottish crown in her right, he
had an indisputable claim to his queen’s dowry, most of
which had never been paid. For this cause he might
have troubled the kingdom; and he had another reason
for interference. His second wife was Isabel, daughter
or sister of Robert Bruce, whose pretensions he might
have supported against those of Baliol. But he declared
for neither party—a degree of moderation, as
we have intimated, attributable rather to his disputes
with the church and with Denmark, than to any other
cause.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1299 to 1319.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>As Eric the Priest-hater left no heirs male, he was
succeeded by his brother <span class='sc'>Hako V.</span> (1299–1319),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>whom he had created duke of Norway, and who had
been admitted to some share in the government. One of
his first objects was to resume the negotiations with
Denmark; but through the intrigues of the men who
were implicated in the murder of Eric Glipping, the signature
of the treaty was delayed until 1308. His transactions
with Sweden are more important, since they led to a
temporary union between the two crowns. His daughter
Ingeburga became the wife of Eric, brother of Birger,
king of Sweden. When Eric was barbarously murdered
by his own brother, Hako armed to revenge the
death of his son-in-law. After a war of some duration,
Birger was compelled to abdicate, and Magnus, the son
of Ingeburga, was elected in his place. As Hako had
no heirs male, and females could not inherit, Magnus
became the heir of the Norwegian throne, to which he
succeeded on the death of Hako.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1319.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Under this prince, who died in 1319, Norway was
not so powerful as it had been under his father: just
as in his father’s time it was not to be compared with
what it had been under the domination of Hako IV.
With this monarch indeed ended the greatness of the
kingdom: from his time to the union of the crown with
that of Denmark, there was a continued decline in the
national prosperity. This decline cannot, as some historians
have asserted, be attributed to the cessation of
piratical expeditions; for in truth they had ceased long
before the reign of Hako IV., or even of Swerro. A
better reason is to be found in the wars between the
kingdom and Denmark—wars which thinned the population,
diminished the national revenues, and aimed a
fatal blow at the national industry. A second is the
monopoly of trade by the Hanseatic Towns. The vessels
of that league had long frequented the coasts of Norway;
Swerro had favoured them; Hako IV. in 1250 had
conferred upon them exclusive privileges; Magnus VI.
had established the foreign merchants in his dominions,
especially at Bergen. Hako also exempted them
from many of the imposts to which they were subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>in other countries. These avaricious strangers did not
benefit the country. Where two people trade, <i>both</i> cannot
be gainers. The advantage was entirely in favour of
these foreigners, who absorbed a traffic which ought to
have been divided into many channels, and by their
monopoly excluded the natives from other markets. In
this respect, we must condemn the short-sighted policy
of Hako, or rather perhaps the engrossing disposition
of the league. But another reason may also be
assigned for the decline of the national prosperity—the
increase of luxury—the creation of artificial wants.
The cardinal bishop of Sabina<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c023'><sup>[168]</sup></a> had expressed surprise
at the condition of the people: he had found, not merely
the comforts, but the luxuries of life. After the visit
of that dignitary, the evil was not mended. The monarchs
were fond of displaying a splendour which richer
and more extensive kingdoms could not well support;
and as the example of the court is sure to be followed
by all who visit it, we may form some notion of the
progress which luxury made amongst the people.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1319 to 1387.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>On the death of Hako, as we have already intimated,
the throne of Norway fell to his grandson <span class='sc'>Magnus VII.</span>
(1319–1343), king of Sweden. In 1343 Magnus resigned
the Norwegian sceptre to his son <span class='sc'>Hako VI.</span>
(1343–1380). This prince, as we have before observed,
married the daughter of Valdemar IV., king of
Denmark, and died in 1380. He was succeeded in
both thrones by his infant son <span class='sc'>Olaf</span> (the <i>fifth</i> of
Norway, the <i>third</i> of Denmark), on whose death both
Denmark and Norway were ruled by queen Margaret.</p>

<p class='c024'>At this period the close connection between the three
northern kingdoms can be explained only by reverting
to the history of Sweden.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='sc'>In</span> Swedish history the chronological difficulties of
which we had so much reason to complain in the former
volume, are scarcely fewer even now that we are advanced
into the eleventh century. Most writers give
different lists of kings down to the twelfth century. The
reason of this difference is two-fold: there were sometimes
two kings reigning at the same time, the one over
the Goths, the other over the Swedes; and sometimes
each of these people had two, who divided the homage
of the people.</p>
<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1001 to 1026.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>All writers agree that at the opening of the eleventh
century <span class='sc'>Olaf</span>, surnamed <i>Skotkonung</i>, or the Tribute-king,
reigned over Sweden. He was the ally of Denmark
in the destruction of Olaf Trygvasen, king of Norway<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c023'><sup>[170]</sup></a>;
and with Denmark he shared the possession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>that kingdom.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c023'><sup>[171]</sup></a> The enemy of St. Olaf, he would not,
though commanded by the states of his kingdom, give
his daughter Ingigerda to that king.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c023'><sup>[172]</sup></a> Contrary to his
wish, however, his second daughter Astrida was married
to his royal neighbor.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c023'><sup>[173]</sup></a> Probably this was the first of
the Swedish princes that felt himself strong enough to
contend with his pagan subjects, who prior to his time
had held the ascendancy.  His ardour, however, is said
to have been mitigated by his diet, which at length decided
for liberty of conscience.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1026 to 1051.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Emund I.</span> (or <span class='sc'>Omund</span>), surnamed <i>Colbrenner</i>, succeeded
to his father. Towards his unfortunate brother-in-law,
St. Olaf of Norway, he acted with severity<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c023'><sup>[174]</sup></a>;
and by all writers testimony is borne to his
virtues. Thus Adam of Bremen informs us that he
excelled all his predecessors in wisdom and piety, and
was more beloved by his people. Of his actions, except
his hostilities in alliance with St. Olaf against
Canute the Great, we are ignorant. Shrouded in equal
obscurity are the actions of his immediate successors.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1051 to 1148.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Emund II.</span> (1051–1056) was unpopular; first,
because he had no zeal for religion; and, secondly, because
in a treaty of limits between Sweden and the
Danish province of Scania, he did not uphold the
national interests, but abandoned a considerable territory
to that rival people. To repair this disaster, and
to prove that he was not afraid of the enemy, he raised
an army and invaded that province; but he was vanquished
and slain. On his death the Swedes and the
Goths, who were often hostile to each other, disagreed
about the succession—the former raising <span class='sc'>Stenkill</span>
(1056–1066), the latter <i>Hako the Red</i>, to the throne.
Thus there were two kingdoms, two courts—the one
reigning over the eastern, the other over the western
and southern provinces. Similar partitions, as we frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>observed in the former volume, had taken place,
so as to confound the chronological succession of the
kings. The Goths and the Swiar had never perfectly
amalgamated, from the period when Odin had led the
latter into Sweden, and expelled the former from the
coast to the interior of the country. But, on the other
hand, experience had taught both of them the destructive
effects of disunion; and on the present occasion,
now that Christianity had made so considerable a progress
among them (more however in Sweden than in
Gothland), they felt more sensibly the impolicy of their
conduct. The heads of the two people met together,
and agreed that Hako should continue to rule over the
Goths, but that on his death his kingdom should cease
to have a separate existence, and be re-merged into that
of Sweden. We shall, however, see that the same moderation
did not always govern the two parties; and
that double elections continued to agitate the commonweal
long after this period. But this circumstance
does not detract from the merit of the men who sanctioned
the present agreement. In thirteen years Hako
paid the debt of nature, and in conformity with the
agreement his crown reverted to the prince of the
Swedes. Of Stenkill the national historians speak with
praise. Of gigantic size, unrivalled strength, and indomitable
courage, he was yet one of the mildest princes
of his age. Over Sweyn II., king of Denmark, he is
said by the Swedish historians to have frequently triumphed;
but of such triumphs we have no record in
the historians of the rival nation. Equal honour is
accorded to his successor <span class='sc'>Inge I.</span>, surnamed <i>the Good</i>.
In his wars this prince is said to have exhibited great
valour; but he was more distinguished for his attachment
to Christianity, and for the zeal with which he
extirpated paganism. In this great work he probably
evinced more ardour than discretion, if it be true that he
was murdered in bed by his idolatrous subjects. <span class='sc'>Halstan</span>,
the brother and successor of Inge, if indeed they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>did not reign conjointly over different parts of the kingdom,
had the same mild virtues. <span class='sc'>Philip</span> and <span class='sc'>Inge II.</span>
were equally worthy of the diadem. Distinguished
alike for his piety and for the rigour with which he
punished the banditti who infested his western provinces,
and the pirates who ravaged his coasts, Inge, in
particular, reigned in the hearts of his people, except
those whose ill deeds he punished. To the hatred of a
faction he became a victim. That faction raised to the
throne <i>Rognerald</i>, a chief of gigantic dimensions and of
fiercer qualities. <i>His</i> yoke was soon felt to be intolerable:
he was removed by violence; and a double election
followed,—the Swedes choosing a chieftain named
<i>Kol</i>; the Goths <i>Magnus</i>, son of Nicholas king of Denmark.
The former soon perished in battle; the latter,
a great tyrant, reigned seven years only (1148), when
the suffrages of the people fell on one who had neither
birth nor connections to recommend him, but who had
the great qualities becoming the dignity. This was
<span class='sc'>Swerker I.</span> It is worthy of remark that Hako the
Red and Rognerald, and Kol and Magnus, are not
usually classed amongst the Swedish kings—at least by
modern historians.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1148 to 1154.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The reign of Swerker was pacific and admirably
adapted to the interests of the kingdom. He was a
wise and patriotic monarch. But he had one grievous
fault—blindness to the vices of his son. Never, if
contemporary chroniclers are to be credited, did a
youth so richly merit the curses of the people. At
the head of a licentious gang, he violated the persons
of the noblest virgins and matrons; he was addicted to
every species of riot; and the insolence of his manners
gave a more odious shade to his vices. In
vain were remonstrances made to the father, whose
first duty, as the people thought, was to insist that his
own family set the first example of obedience to the
laws. Indignant at this guilty toleration, the people
arose and murdered the prince. Swerker’s own end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>was tragical; but whether he died through the influence
of the same conspirators, or through the avarice
of a domestic, is doubtful. On his death, the same
ruinous division took place as in the preceding century:
the Goths elected <span class='sc'>Charles</span>, another son of
Swerker; the Swedes made choice of <span class='sc'>St. Eric</span>, who
had married the daughter of Inge the Good—a name
dear to the people. As civil war was so much to be
deprecated, the heads of both parties met and agreed
to this compromise—that Eric I. should retain both
crowns during his life, and on his death both should
be inherited by Charles. But what was to become of
the rights of their children? To prevent future disputes,
the descendants of each were to rule alternately,
without prejudice, however, to the elective suffrage of
the people. It would have been impossible to devise
any expedient better adapted to produce the contrary
of what was intended.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1155 to 1167.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The reign of Eric was one of vigour. The Finns,
who had declared themselves independent, he reduced
to subjection; and he also forced them, we are told, to
forsake idolatry for Christianity. We may, however,
doubt whether his efforts in this respect were so general
as the chroniclers would have us believe: certainly,
they were not very permanent; for there are pagans
amongst them at this very day, and those who pass for
Christians worship other gods. Probably they did as
most barbarians do in similar circumstances—they
submitted while the victor was near them, but reverted
to their ancient superstitions when he had left. That
he had idolaters nearer to him than Finland, and more
immediately subject to his sway, is evident from the
distinction he was accused of making between the worshippers
of Odin and those of Christ. The former he
deprived of the rights which the law conferred upon
them. For this conduct he naturally incurred their
indignation, and he also made enemies of another
party—the licentious, the disturbers of the public tranquillity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>who were scarcely less numerous. Both conspired
against him; and as their own strength was
inadequate to the object, they invoked the aid of the
Danish king, offering, as it appears, the crown of
Sweden to the son of that monarch. A Danish army
arrived, and being joined by the malcontents, marched
towards Upsal. They were soon met by Eric who,
though he performed prodigies of valour, was defeated
and slain. His tragical death was one of the causes
that led to his canonization. Another was the zeal
which he showed in the extirpation of idolaters, whom
he pursued with fire and sword. Add that he was the
founder of monasteries and churches, and we have
reasons enough for his deification. By most readers
he will be valued, less for his unenlightened devotion,
than for his compilation of a code of laws—“St. Eric’s
Lag.” Yet the provisions which it contains are deeply
impressed by his dominant characteristics. Against
pagans they are sanguinary; and they visit offences
against the Christian religion and the Christian worship
with stern severity.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1161 to 1167.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Charles, the son of Swerker, was now monarch of the
whole country. But he had some difficulty in expelling
the invaders, who had proclaimed the son of the
Danish king. He, too, was much attached to the church,
and to which he was more generous than even his predecessor.
If tradition be true (there is no contemporary
authority for the statement), he embarrassed his affairs by
his immoderate liberality. As he obtained from the pope
the erection of an archbishopric,—that of Upsal,—he
was expected to endow it. From his munificence in
this respect, may have originated the report in question.
His reign was not exempt from trouble. The adherents
of the rival dynasty were his enemies, from a suspicion
(apparently ill-founded) that he had been one of the
conspirators against St. Eric. Though in conformity
with the agreement which we have mentioned, he nominated
Canute, the son of Eric, his successor, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>prince would not remain in the kingdom, under the
pretence that his life was in danger. In a few years he
returned into Sweden, at the head of a considerable
Norwegian force, was joined by the partisans of his
house, and enabled to triumph over his rival, whom
he captured and beheaded. This act he justified by
appealing to the untimely end of his father, which he
represented as the work of Charles.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1167 to 1192.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The reign of <span class='sc'>Canute</span> was disturbed by two invasions.
The first, consisting of Danes, who had armed
to revenge the death of the late king, or rather under
that plea to profit by the disasters of a rival country.
The Goths, who loved the memory of Charles, immediately
joined it; but the king was victorious. The
second was an irruption of the Esthonian pirates, who
laid Sigtuna in ashes, slew the archbishop of Upsal, and
carried away many prisoners before the king could
overtake them.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1192 to 1210.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Swerker II.</span>, the son of Charles, was the next
king, in virtue of the compact between the Goths and
the Swedes. But every day more clearly evinced the
dangers resulting from that compact: it daily widened
the breach, not merely between the two royal families, but
between the two great tribes which constituted the nation.
Blood had been openly or treacherously spilt by both
parties; and the deadly feud had descended to the chiefs
of both. It was, from the first, the object of Swerker
to exterminate the family of his rival; but one prince—Eric,
the only son of the late king—escaped into
Norway. For some years he governed with moderation;
but becoming tyrannical, the people of Upland invited
the exile to return. Eric obeyed the call, was joined
by most of the nobles, and enabled to triumph over
Swerker, though the latter was supported by a Danish
army. The king was expelled, and though he subsequently
returned twice to renew the contest, twice he
was defeated, and on the latter occasion his own corpse
was among the slain.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1210 to 1250.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The reign of <span class='sc'>Eric II.</span> commenced by more policy
than could have been anticipated from preceding events.
To pacify the rival faction, he declared prince John, the
son of Swerker, his successor. To conciliate the Danes,
who had so warmly espoused the cause of his rivals, he
obtained the hand of a Danish princess, the sister of
Valdemar II. His reign was pacific, but too short for
the interests of his people. <span class='sc'>John I.</span> (1220–1222)
ascended without opposition the united thrones of the
Swedes and the Goths; but his reign was still shorter—a
misfortune the more keenly felt from his admirable conduct.
If he was less fortunate in two or three military
expeditions (so obscure, however, as scarcely to deserve
notice) than was hoped from the justice of his cause, his
civil government was one of great success. He was
succeeded without opposition by the son of his predecessor,
Eric II., named after the father. <span class='sc'>Eric III.</span>,
surnamed the Lisper (1222–1230), had a reign less
peaceful than those which immediately preceded it.
There was a family in the realm too powerful for obedience—that
of the Folkungar—the chiefs of which,
by their wealth and their numerous connections, evidently
aspired to the throne. To bind them to his interests,
he married two of his sisters to nobles of that
house, while he himself took to wife a lady of that
family. But these alliances, as might indeed have been
expected, only gave a new impulse to ambition. To
wrest the crown from him, the whole family or tribe,
the chiefs of which must have been connected with the
royal line of either the Goths or the Swedes, broke out
into rebellion—one noble only, the jarl Birger, remaining
faithful to him. In the first battle Eric was defeated
and compelled to flee; but he raised an army in
Denmark, returned to Sweden, vanquished the usurper
Sweyn, and was again acknowledged by the whole realm.
In the last year of his reign, he sent an expedition
against the Finns, who had reverted to idolatry. It
was commanded by Birger Jarl, on whom he had conferred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>the hand of his youngest sister. The cruelty of
the general, who probably acted in obedience to the
royal orders, equalled that of the former military apostle,
St. Eric.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1250.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The death of Eric the Stammerer was followed by a
violation of the compact which had established the alternate
order of succession. The Folkungar nobles no
longer concealed their intention of aspiring to the throne.
Through the intrigues of a dependent, when the diet
met for a new election, the choice fell on <span class='sc'>Valdemar I.</span>,
the son of Birger Jarl by the sister of the late king.
On the part of the electors, this was an attempt to combine
the interests of two great families. But Birger
was dissatisfied: he had expected the crown himself;
and he objected to the impolicy of choosing a child like
his son. His design was to obtain the regency, and he
succeeded.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1251 to 1266.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>However censurable the means by which Birger arrived
at power, he had qualities worthy of the post.
He founded Stockholm, which he also fortified: he revised
and greatly improved the Landslag, or written
laws of the kingdom; he conferred on the cities and
towns privileges similar to those contained in the charters
of later ages; he improved the internal administration
in other respects; while he defended the coasts
against the ravages of the pirates. Such indeed was
the prosperity which he introduced, that the diet requested
the king to confer on him the ducal title—a
title previously unknown in Sweden. But the success
of his administration, and the power held by his family,
incurred first the jealousy, and soon the hatred of a
faction, or rather of several factions who united to oppose
him. Among the great Swedish families was one
that rivalled the Folkungar in riches, in the number of
its armed dependents, in its widely-spread connection.
This was the Folkungar family, which had beheld with
the deepest mortification the elevation of a rival house.
A civil war followed, which was indecisive; and it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>ended by a pacification, but a pacification dictated by
deceit. After Birger had solemnly sworn to it, and the
heads of the other party repaired in unsuspecting confidence
to his camp, he caused them to be put to death.
One noble only escaped, Charles, who fled to the Teutonic
knights, became a member of the order, and left
an heroic name behind him. This perfidious act is a
sad stain on the glory of his regency. Another was his
excessive love of power, which induced him to retain
the reins of government long after his son had arrived
at manhood, and even after that son had married Sophia,
daughter of Eric Plough-penny, king of Denmark.
Death only caused him to release his grasp.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1266 to 1276.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The reign of Valdemar was one of trouble. Whether
through the persuasion of the diet, or through fraternal
attachment, he tolerated, if he did not himself
establish, the independence of his brothers. Magnus
duke of Sudermania, Eric prince of Smaland, and Benvit
duke of Finland, had separate courts, and exercised
a sovereign authority in their respective jurisdictions.
Magnus, the eldest, was formed for a monarch. He was
learned, courteous, generous, and highly accomplished
in all military sciences. So popular did he become,
that his palace was more frequented than the king’s.
Of his popularity Valdemar soon became jealous;
yet he could do no other than leave the regency to
Magnus during his pilgrimage to Rome. The motive
of this pilgrimage was to expiate a criminal connection,
of many years’ standing, with Judith, sister of his queen.
The severity of the penance was owing to the fact of
Judith’s being a nun, who had precipitately fled from
the convent of Roskild. Nine children were the result
of this connection, which so scandalised the church,
that the pope would not give him absolution until he
had visited the Holy Land. Judith was condemned to
perpetual seclusion. In 1276, after an absence of
nearly three years, the royal penitent returned, and accused
Magnus of intriguing for the throne. Whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>there was any truth in the charge, cannot well be ascertained;
but that suspicion should arise in his mind
was inevitable. He was jealous, not of Eric only, but
of all his brothers. On this occasion, Benvit, the youngest,
exhibited a proof of magnanimity which may well
obtain the praise of history: to consolidate the royal
power, he resigned his duchy, took holy orders, and
subsequently became bishop of Linkoping. The elder
brothers, far from imitating the example, united themselves
closely with the Danes, and a civil war followed.
Valdemar was surprised, pursued, and captured. To
end these disorders, the diet met, and divided the kingdom
between the two brothers. To Valdemar was conceded
the two Gothlands (East and West) with Smaland
and Dalia: the rest fell to Magnus.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1276 to 1279.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>This peace was of short continuance. Magnus did
not pay his Danish auxiliaries, by whose aid he had
triumphed. In revenge the Danish king ravaged the
Swedish provinces, and entered into a treaty with Valdemar
to restore him to the undivided throne. At the
head of a Danish army, Valdemar marched against
Magnus, but was defeated. To repair this disaster,
Eric of Denmark took the field with a large army—so
large that Magnus would not risk an action. But
the Swedish prince obtained by policy the advantage
which arms could not give him. He drew the invaders
into the heart of the kingdom; cut off all supplies; and
awaited the approach of winter to effect their destruction.
But through the mediation of the chiefs on both
sides, peace was restored. As Magnus had not the
money due to Eric, he pledged one of his maritime
towns. In return, he obtained not merely a friend, but
his recognition as monarch of Norway. Valdemar, thus
sacrificed, was made to renounce his claim to the whole
country, and to pass the remainder of his days in Denmark,
on one of the domains which he had received
with his queen.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1279, 1280.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Magnus I.</span> at his accession assumed the title of king
of the Swedes and the Goths, to denote his superiority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>over the whole kingdom. But the title was more
pompous than the power. He was soon accused of
undue partiality towards the people of Holstein, who
in virtue of his marriage with Hedwige, sister of the
count Gerard<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c023'><sup>[175]</sup></a>, flocked to Sweden in great numbers.
The remonstrance did not weaken his attachment to
these foreigners, whom he loaded with honours. To the
great families, especially that of the Folkungar, this
preference was gall; and a conspiracy was formed to
extirpate the odious strangers. An opportunity for the
execution of this plot soon arrived. Escorted by a
considerable number of Holsteiners, the queen proceeded
to Scara, a town of Gothland, to meet her father. The
conspirators followed, and massacred the guard, including
even the brother-in-law of the king. Nor was this
all: they threw the count of Holstein into a dungeon;
and they certainly would have laid their hands on the
queen, had she not contrived to escape into a monastery.
Knowing the power of the family which had instigated
these excesses, and fearing that they were supported by
foreign alliances, the king dissimulated, and made use of
the most conciliating language, until he had obtained the
enlargement of the count. He then summoned a diet,
charged the unsuspicious Folkungar with high treason,
sent them to Stockholm, and beheaded all of them except
one, who was allowed to be ransomed. From this
time that ambitious family ceased to have much influence
over the realm. To establish his throne still more
solidly, he entered into a double matrimonial alliance
with Denmark. His son Birger, still a child, was affianced
to a daughter of the Danish king, and as she too
was a child, she was taken, in conformity with the
custom of the times, to the Swedish court to be educated.
And soon afterwards Ingeburga, daughter of Magnus,
became the wife of Eric Plough-penny’s successor.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1281 to 1290.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The tranquillity obtained through these measures
enabled Magnus to devote his whole time to the internal
administration. His name is mentioned with great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>praise; and he appears to have deserved it. His consolidated
power and his firmness were indeed blessings
to a realm so long distracted by intestine commotions.
It was feared, indeed, lest, in his hands, the sceptre
should become oppressive: but this too would have
been an advantage; for its weight would have fallen on
the powerful and the turbulent only. To the peasant he
was a friend. Prior to his reign, the local nobles had
not hesitated to levy contributions on the despised portion
of the nation. He decreed that whoever took any thing
from a poor man’s hut without paying the value, should
be visited with rigorous penalties. From his brother
Valdemar he sustained some trouble; but he crushed
the seeds of rebellion by imprisoning that restless prince.
To support, with greater magnificence, the regal state,
he obtained, from the gratitude of his people, a considerable
augmentation of his resources. This augmentation
consisted in certain returns from the mines, and
from the great lakes of Sweden. Well did he merit this
liberality; for never had the country a greater king.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1290 to 1305.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Birger</span>, the son of Magnus, being only eleven years
old at his father’s death, the regency devolved on Thorkil,
a noble Swede. Nothing can better illustrate the merit of
Magnus than this choice. At home and abroad Thorkil
evinced his talents and his patriotism. His expeditions
against the Finns, the Carelians, and the Ingrians, were
crowned with success. But his great object was to render
the people happy. Having reason to fear the interruption
of the social tranquillity, he arrested the sons of the
late king Valdemar, who could not forget their claims
to the throne. But as Birger rose up to manhood,
he had still more cause of apprehension from Eric and
Valdemar, brothers of his sovereign. Both evidently
aspired to distinct governments. To strengthen his
interests, the former married Ingeburga, daughter of
Hako V., king of Norway. Seeing that he and Valdemar
were acting more openly in pursuit of their treasonable
object, yet unwilling to adopt extreme measures,
Birger, with the advice of his minister, obtained from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>them a written pledge never to leave the kingdom, or
approach the royal residence without permission; never
to conspire against the government; never to maintain
more than a given number of armed men; and always
to obey the commands of their sovereign. But what
engagement could bind spirits so restless, which were
emboldened to attempt any thing by the success of preceding
rebels? The princes still continued to plot;
and to escape imprisonment, they fled into Denmark.
The Danish king, however, being persuaded to abandon
them, they took refuge in Norway, were friendly received
by Hako, and enabled, from their new fiefs of
Nydborg and Konghella, to lay waste the neighbouring
provinces with fire and sword. A body of troops sent
by Birger to repulse them, was defeated. A second
army was raised; and the king marched in person to
chastise his brothers. They were, however, at the head
of a large force, not of their own partisans merely, but of
the Norwegians; and to avoid the effusion of blood, a
pacification was recommended. They were received
into favour on the condition of their swearing obedience
to the king: in return he conferred on duke Eric the
fief of Varberg. The next feature of this transaction
was the sacrifice of the able and patriotic Thorkil. The
brothers could not forgive him for thwarting them in
their rebellion; and Birger was made to believe the
vilest calumnies respecting him. The aged minister was
sent to Stockholm and beheaded. At the same time his
daughter, the wife of Valdemar, was repudiated. Thus
was a long course of public service rewarded!</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1305 to 1319.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>By this criminal weakness, Birger was righteously
left to the intrigues of his brothers. By them he was
surprised and made prisoner, together with his wife and
children, and forced to resign the crown in favour of
Eric. His eldest son, Magnus, escaped, and fled to
Denmark, the king of which armed for the restoration
of his sister’s husband. From this period to the close
of Birger’s reign there was war, alternated by hollow
peace. In 1307, he obtained his liberty, on the condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>of his kingdom being dismembered in favour of
his brother. To revoke this dangerous act he renewed
his alliance with Denmark, and again obtained help; but
his proceedings were not decisive, and a new pacification
followed, on conditions similar to the preceding, except
that Birger was now regarded as the liege superior
of his brothers, who did homage to him for their fiefs.
Unable to reduce them by force, he had recourse to the
usual acts of the base. He pretended great affection
for them, and sent them many presents. At length
alluring them to his court at Nykoping, he arrested
them in bed, and consigned them to dungeons with expression
of triumphant insult more galling than the
perfidy itself. One died of the wounds which he had
received in the effort to escape: the other was starved
to death. But from this deed of blood the king derived
no advantage. The bodies of the murdered princes
being exposed to the public, roused the wrath of the
very numerous party hostile to his government. The
civil war was now renewed by Matthias Kettlemundson
in behalf of duke Eric’s son. Since the death of Thorkil,
the king had become rapacious, tyrannical, and consequently
unpopular. The people, who lamented the fate
of the murdered princes, favoured the cause which Kettlemundson
had espoused; the fortresses that still held
for the king were soon reduced: Magnus, his son, was
made prisoner; and he himself compelled to seek a
refuge in Denmark, where he was coldly received.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1319, 1320.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Fate had not yet done its worst for this exiled prince.
A diet was assembled to choose a successor. Such was
the hatred borne towards him and his line, that his son
Magnus was beheaded for <i>his</i> crimes. The suffrages of
the electors united in favour of duke Eric’s son, a child
three years old. Grief the following year (1320) brought
Birger to the tomb. Whatever good signalised his
reign must be attributed to his able and virtuous minister:
his own conduct was dictated by odious vices.
Thorkil caused a law to be passed against the sale of
slaves, on the ground that it was in the highest degree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>criminal for Christians to sell men whom Christ had
redeemed by his blood. This noble truth is the best
testimony to the character of that minister: we may
add that it is the most deplorable illustration of the
king’s, who could, without a cause, sacrifice such a man.
What better than fratricide could be expected from
him?</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1319 to 1354.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>During the long minority of <span class='sc'>Magnus II.</span>, the regency
was exercised by Kettlemundson, who had contributed
so largely to the expulsion of Birger, and the
execution of the blameless Magnus, the son of Birger.
His administration, which continued eighteen years,
is mentioned with respect; but it was signalised by no
great exploit deserving the attention of history. Both
his policy and that of his sovereign, in respect to Scania,
has been related.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c023'><sup>[176]</sup></a> In the administration of justice
and the maintenance of the public tranquillity, he was
successful. On his demise, Magnus assumed the reins
of government; but did not give so much satisfaction
as his minister. He undertook an expedition against the
western provinces of Russia (then subject to their own
princes), influenced only by a wild ambition. The result
was not glorious. The taxes which he levied on
the people for its support, gave rise to complaint. The
pope too complained that he had appropriated to his own
use the money, which, in virtue of Olaf Skotkonung’s
act, should have gone to the Roman treasury. Still
his necessities increased: the purchase of Scania was
another channel of expenditure; and though he pledged
some of the royal domains, he had still to exact more
from his people, including the clergy, than their patience
would support. For this cause he was excommunicated
by the pope. Regardless of murmurs, he proceeded in
his course: he was distinguished alike for rashness,
feebleness, and irresolution. Governed by young favourites,
and still more by his queen, who persuaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>him that he might do whatever he pleased with impunity,
and anxious to place a third crown on his brow
(he had inherited Norway in right of his mother), he
exhibited at once his silly ambition and his incapacity
by embroiling himself with Denmark. So far from obtaining
that crown, he lost his own. The diet insisted
that he should resign Norway to Hako, and Sweden to
Eric, his two sons. He fled into Scania; implored the
aid of Valdemar; and in return ceded that province
to the Danish crown.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c023'><sup>[177]</sup></a> He was enabled by this means
and by the support of a party (for what king was ever
without one?) to carry on a war with Eric. Its ravages
were deeply felt; its issue was dubious; and a diet was
convoked at Jenkoping to avert by a pacification the
ruin of the monarchy. Under the mediation of two
princes connected with the royal family, it was decreed
that the country should be divided between the father
and the son: to the former were assigned Upland, the
two Gothias, Vermeland, Dalecarlia, with the northern
portion of Halland, and the isle of Oeland; to the
latter, Finland, Smaland, the southern portion of Halland,
and Scania.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1354 to 1357.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The indiscretions of Magnus had lost him the hearts
of his people, which turned with ardour to <span class='sc'>Eric IV.</span>
This circumstance roused the jealousy of him and his
queen, who are said to have conspired against the life
of Eric. Whether he was removed by poison administered
to him by his mother, or by the violence of
conspirators, or by lawless banditti, or, finally, by natural
causes, must for ever rest unknown, since ancient
annals say nothing on the subject. The majority of
historians, native and foreign, concur in fixing the guilt
on queen Blanche; but until some better evidence than
any they have adduced be brought to establish so unnatural
a crime, the common feeling of mankind must
compel them to doubt it. The only fact that is certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>is that Eric died, and that Magnus profited by the event,
since it restored him to the monarchy.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1357 to 1363.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>It was impossible for this weak and unscrupulous
prince to win the esteem of the Swedes. He hated
them because they had deposed him; and to be revenged
on them, he entered into a close alliance with
Valdemar of Denmark. Valdemar, to whom he ceded
Scania, became, as we have before related, the willing
instrument of that vengeance in the sack of Wisby
and in other depredations.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c023'><sup>[178]</sup></a> This was not the way to
acquire popularity: he and the whole Danish nation
were soon detested; nor was the feeling diminished
when the secret transpired of a projected union between
the king’s son, Hako of Norway, and Margaret, the
daughter of Valdemar. To prevent this obnoxious
alliance, the nobles arose, imprisoned Magnus in the
fortress of Calmar, called on Hako to assume the administration,
and made him promise not only that he
would renounce all connection with Denmark, but
marry Elizabeth, sister of Henry count of Holstein.
Though <span class='sc'>Hako II.</span> (the sixth of Norway) engaged to
fulfil the wishes of the diet, neither he nor his father,
who was soon enlarged, had the least intention to do so.
On the contrary, they renewed their connection still
more closely with the obnoxious Valdemar. The manner
in which Elizabeth was deluded by that monarch
until the marriage of his daughter with Hako was celebrated,
has been already described.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1363.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>Nothing could exceed the anger of the Swedes, or
rather of a considerable faction (for the majority were
passive) when they heard of this marriage. Determined
to exclude both father and son, they invited
Henry of Holstein, who was connected with the royal
line, to ascend the throne. But Henry was an old
man; and he would not risk his tranquillity for an
object that he could not long enjoy. He recommended
the electors to make choice of Albert duke of Mecklenburg,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>whose mother was the sister of Magnus. But
the duke had no wish to rule a divided, turbulent people;
nor did he wish his eldest son to undertake the
perilous charge. He had, however, a second son, also
named Albert, who had nothing to lose, and whom he
recommended to the suffrages of the electors.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1364 to 1371.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Albert</span> arrived at Stockholm early in 1364. That
city was in the interests of Magnus, and for a time it
resisted; but he forced or persuaded it to capitulate.
There he was joined by most of the nobles who were
discontented with Magnus. Their first act was to renew
the deposition of the one; their next, to confirm
the election of the other. Hako, then in Norway, prepared
to invade the kingdom; and Magnus, who had
still a party, effected a junction with him. Their army
being augmented by a considerable number of Danes,
they penetrated into Upland. But Albert, on his side,
hastened to oppose them; and in a battle of some magnitude,
victory the most decisive inclined to his standard: Magnus
was taken prisoner; Hako was wounded
and compelled to retreat with expedition into his own
kingdom. The fortresses which held for the two
princes were next reduced; two or three of them only
made a vigorous defence. But Valdemar of Denmark,
whose interest lay in disturbing the kingdom, sent, from
time to time, supplies of troops, which harassed the
king. Peace with that formidable rival was felt to be
necessary for the repose of the realm, and it was purchased
by the cession of some domains. Among them
was the isle of Gothland with Wisby the capital. That
these cessions were unwillingly made, may be easily
conceived; and to procure their restoration, Albert entered
into a close league with the enemies of Denmark.
The war was consequently renewed. While his allies
assailed other parts of Denmark, he invaded Scania, a
portion of which he reduced. But little time was
left him for exultation. Hako of Norway invaded
Sweden, defeated him, and compelled him to throw himself
into Stockholm, which was closely invested. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>this extremity he proposed an interview, in which the
conditions of peace were agreed on. Magnus was enlarged
for a ransom of 12,000 marks; and in return
for his cession of the Swedish crown, he received as
fiefs West Gothland, Vermeland, and Dalia. He was,
however, to have no share in the administration of these
provinces, but merely to receive the revenues with the
title of governor; and the rest of his days he was to
pass in Norway. Lest he should break this, with as
much levity as he had broken all his former engagements,
sixty gentlemen of his party were to surrender
themselves prisoners to Albert, if he should again disturb
the peace of the realm. He did not disturb it,
because he was soon afterwards drowned in crossing a
ford.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1371 to 1376.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>For some years after this pacification Albert enjoyed
comparative security. But he was not popular: he
brought over many greedy Germans to share in the
spoils of the kingdom; and exhibited in their favour a
partiality so gross as much to indispose the nation
against him. Like a true German, indeed, he had little
regard for any thing beyond his immediate interests,
and those of his family. Insecure as was his possession
of Sweden, he raised troops to support the claims of his
nephew, Albert of Mecklenburg, to the Danish throne,
in opposition to Olaf, the son of Margaret and Hako.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c023'><sup>[179]</sup></a>
The enterprise failed: the armament that was sent
against the Danes was mostly destroyed by a storm;
and there was no disposition to renew the contest.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1377 to 1387.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>The gross partiality of Albert for his foreign mercenaries
was not the only fault he committed. Having
a high notion of the kingly prerogative, he endeavoured
to rule without the control of the diet. For his attempt
to restrain the privileges of the nobles he would deserve
our praise, were not his motives of the most selfish character.
The people had still more reason to complain.
Not only were they subject to a tyranny odious as that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>of the nobles, but they were ground to the earth by new
imposts, and, what was still more mortifying, for the
enrichment of avaricious foreigners. In this state of
the public mind, he convoked a diet at Stockholm, and
demanded an augmentation of his income. It was not,
he observed, adequate to the decent support of royalty;
and he solicited one third of the whole revenue,
civil and ecclesiastical. Nothing could equal the indignant
surprise of the diet at this extraordinary demand.
They replied that former kings had found the usual
revenues enough, not merely for comfort but for splendour;
and intimated that if he was straitened, the cause
lay in the number of foreigners whom he enriched.
This intimation might have been expected to produce
some good effect; but it had none on this imprudent
king except to exasperate him, and to make him resolve
that he would wrest by force what had been refused to
his solicitations. In vain did both nobles and clergy
cry aloud against his arbitrary purpose: in vain did
they call upon him to respect the privileges which he
had sworn to maintain; he persevered, and consequently
plunged the kingdom into a ruinous civil war.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1388 to 1389.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c024'>At this time Margaret, who had succeeded to her
son Olaf, was sovereign of Denmark and Norway.
To her the malcontents applied for aid, which she
would not afford them, unless they acknowledged her
for their queen. The condition was accepted: an army
of Danes marched into Sweden, and was immediately
joined by many of the nobles and clergy. The lower
classes of the population—those who contributed little
to the support of the state—were indifferent to the result,
or if they had any bias, it was in favour of Albert—not
from any attachment to him, but from dislike of
the nobles. At Falkoping, in West Gothland, however,
a good stand was made by his army, consisting not
merely of Swedes but of Germans, and many adventurers
whom the offer of large pay and the hope of
plunder had drawn to his standard. But after a desperate
conflict, he was defeated, and captured, together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>with his son. Both were committed to a fortress, where,
notwithstanding the efforts of their German allies, and
those of their own party, they remained above six years;
nor did they obtain their enlargement without a solemn
renunciation of the Swedish crown.</p>

<p class='c012'>From his life, faithfully written by Ælnoth, a monk of Canterbury, who
had lived twenty-four years in Denmark, and wrote in 1105. It was

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>St. Canutus</span>, or <span class='sc'>Knut</span>, the fourth of that name, king of Denmark,
was natural son of Swein III. whose great uncle Canutus
had reigned in England. Swein, having no lawful
issue, took care of the education of Canutus, who being endowed
with excellent qualities both of mind and body,
answered perfectly well the care of his preceptors and governors.
It is hard to say whether he excelled more in courage,
or in conduct and skill in war; but his singular piety
perfectly eclipsed all his other endowments. He scoured the
seas of pirates, and subdued several neighbouring provinces
which infested Denmark with their incursions. The kingdom
of Denmark was elective till the year 1660; wherefore, when
Swein died, many pitched upon our saint, whose eminent
virtues best qualified him for the throne; but the majority,
fearing his martial spirit, preferred his eldest natural brother
Harald, the seventh king of that name, who, for his stupidity
and vices, was commonly called the Slothful. Canutus retired
into Sweden to king Halstan, who received him with the
greatest marks of kindness and esteem; but the king could
never induce him to undertake any expedition against Denmark;
on the contrary, the Christian hero employed all his
power and interest in the service of his country. Harald
dying after two years’ reign, Canutus was called to succeed
him.</p>
<p class='c024'>Denmark had received the Christian faith long before, some
say in 826, but wanted a zealous hand at the helm, to put the
finishing stroke to that good work. St. Canutus seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>have been pitched upon by Providence for this purpose. He
began his reign by a successful war against the troublesome
barbarous enemies of the state, and by planting the faith in
the conquered provinces of Courland, Samogitia, and Livonia.
Amidst the glory of his victories, he humbly prostrated himself
at the foot of the crucifix, laying there his diadem, and
offering himself and his kingdom to the King of kings. After
having provided for its peace and safety, and enlarged its
territories, he married Eltha, or Alice, daughter of Robert
earl of Flanders, by whom he had a pious son, St. Charles,
surnamed the Good, afterward also earl of Flanders. His
next concern was to reform abuses at home. For this purpose,
he enacted severe, but necessary laws, for the strict administration
of justice, and repressed the violence and tyranny of the
great, without respect of persons. He countenanced and
honoured holy men, granted many privileges and immunities
to the clergy, to enhance the people’s esteem of them; and
omitted nothing to convince them of their obligation to provide
for their subsistence by the payment of tithes. His
charity and tenderness towards his subjects made him study
by all possible ways to ease them of their burdens, and make
them a happy people. He showed a royal magnificence in
building and adorning churches, and gave the crown which he
wore, of exceeding great value, to the church of Roschild, in
Zealand, his capital city, and the place of his residence, where
the kings of Denmark are yet buried. He chastised his body
with fasting, discipline, and hair-cloths. Prayer was his assiduous
exercise. When William the Conqueror had made
himself master of England, Canutus sent forces to assist the
vanquished: but these troops finding no one willing to join
them, were easily defeated in the year 1069. Some time after,
being invited by the conquered English, he raised an army
to invade this island, and expel the Normans; but through the
treacherous practices of his brother Olas, or Olaus, was obliged
to wait so long on the coast that his troops deserted him.
The pious king, having always in view the service of God,
and judging this a proper occasion to induce the people to
pay tithes to their pastors, he proposed to them either to pay
a heavy fine, by way of punishment for their desertion, or
submit to the law of tithes for the pastors of the church. Their
aversion to the latter made them choose the tax, to the great
mortification of the king, who, hoping they would change
their resolution, ordered it to be levied with rigour. But they,
being incensed at the severity of the collectors, rebelled. St.
Canutus retired for safety into the isle of Fionia, and was hindered
from joining his loyal troops, by the treachery of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Blanco, an officer, who, to deceive him, assured his majesty
that the rebels were returned to their duty. The king went
to the church of St. Alban, the martyr, to perform his devotions,
and return God thanks for that happy event. This the
rebels being informed of by Blanco, they surrounded the
church with him at their head. In the mean time the holy
king, perceiving the danger that threatened his life, confessed
his sins at the foot of the altar, with great tranquillity and
resignation, and received the holy communion. His guards
defended the church doors, and Blanco was slain by them.
The rebels threw in bricks and stones, through the windows,
by which they beat down the shrines of certain relics of St.
Alban and St. Oswald, which St. Canutus had brought over
from England. The saint, stretching out his arms before the
altar, fervently recommended his soul into the hands of the
Creator; in which posture he was wounded with a javelin
darted through the window, and fell a victim to Christ. His
brother Benedict, and seventeen others, were slain with him,
on the 10th of July, 1086, as Ælnoth, a contemporary author,
testifies, who has specified the date of all the events with the
utmost exactness. His wicked brother Olas succeeded him
in the kingdom. God punished the people during eight years
and three months of his reign with a dreadful famine, and other
calamities; and attested the sanctity of the martyr, by many
miraculous cures of the sick at his tomb. For which reason
his relics were taken up out of their obscure sepulchre, and
honourably entombed towards the end of the reign of Olas.
His successor, Eric III., a most religious prince, restored
piety and religion, with equal courage and success, and sent
ambassadors to Rome, with proofs of the miracles performed,
and obtained from the pope a declaration, authorising the
veneration of St. Canutus, the proto-martyr of Denmark.
Upon this occasion a most solemn translation of his relics,
which were put in a most costly shrine, was performed, at
which Ælnoth, our historian, was present. He adds, that the
first preachers of the faith in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway,
were English priests; that the Danes then zealously embraced
the Christian religion, but that the Swedes still continued
more obstinate, among whom Eschill, an Englishman,
received the crown of martyrdom, whilst he was preaching
Christ to certain savage tribes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r86'>86</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This poem has been thus versified by the Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert,
in his “Select Icelandic Poetry”:—</p>

<p class='c045'>Wroth waxed Thor, when his sleep was flown,
And he found his trusty hammer gone;
He smote his brow, his beard he shook,
The son of earth ’gan round him look;
And this, the first word that he spoke;
“Now listen what I tell thee, Loke;
Which neither on earth below is known,
Nor in Heaven above—my hammer’s gone.”
Their way to Freyia’s bower they took,
And this, the first word that he spoke;
“Thou, Freyia, must lend a winged robe,
To seek my hammer round the globe.”</p>
<p class='c046'><span class='sc'>Freyia</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“That shouldst thou have, though ’twere of gold,
And that, though ’twere of silver, hold.”<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c023'><sup>[87]</sup></a>
Away flew Loke; the wing’d robe sounds,
Ere he has left the Asgard grounds,
And ere he has reach’d the Jotunheim bounds.
High on a mound in haughty state
Thrym the king  of the Thursi sate;
For his dogs he was twisting collars of gold,
And trimming the manes of his coursers bold.</p>
<p class='c046'><span class='sc'>Thrym</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“How fare the Asi? the Alfi how?
Why com’st thou alone to Jotunheim now?”</p>
<p class='c046'><span class='sc'>Loke</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Ill fare the Asi; the Alfi mourn;
Thor’s hammer from him thou hast torn.”</p>
<p class='c046'><span class='sc'>Thrym</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“I have the Thunderer’s hammer bound,
Fathoms eight beneath the ground;
With it shall no one homeward tread,
Till he bring me Freyia to share my bed.”
Away flew Loke; the wing’d robe sounds,
Ere he has left the Jotunheim bounds,
And ere he has reach’d the Asgard grounds.
At Midgard Thor met crafty Loke,
And this the first word that he spoke;
“Have you your errand and labour done?
Tell from aloft the course you run.
For setting oft the story fails,
And lying oft the lie prevails.”</p>
<p class='c046'><span class='sc'>Loke</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“My labour is past, mine errand I bring;
Thrym has thine hammer, the giant king;
With it shall no one homeward tread,
Till he bear him Freyia to share his bed.”
Their way to lovely Freyia they took,
And this the first word that he spoke;
“Now Freyia, busk as a blooming bride,
Together, we must to Jotunheim ride.”
Wroth waxed Freyia with ireful look;
All Asgard’s hall with wonder shook;
Her great bright necklace started wide.
“Well may ye call me a wanton bride,
If I with ye to Jotunheim ride.”
The Asi did all to council crowd,
The Asiniæ all talk’d fast and loud:
This they debated, and this they sought,
How the hammer of Thor should home be brought.
Up then and spoke Heimdallar free,
Like the Vani, wise was he;
“Now busk<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c023'><sup>[88]</sup></a> we Thor, as a bride so fair;
Let him that great bright necklace wear;
Round him let ring the spousal keys;
And a maiden kirtle<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c023'><sup>[89]</sup></a> hang to his knees,
And on his bosom jewels rare;
And high and quaintly braid his hair.”
Wroth waxed Thor with godlike pride;
“Well may the Asi me deride,
If I let me dight<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c023'><sup>[90]</sup></a>, as a blooming bride.”
Then up spoke Loke, Laufeyia’s son;
“Now hush thee, Thor; this must be done:
The giants will strait in Asgard reign,
If thou thine hammer dost not regain.”
Then busk’d they Thor, as a bride so fair,
And the great bright necklace gave him to wear;
Round him let ring the spousal keys,
And a maiden kirtle hang to his knees,
And on his bosom jewels rare;
And high and quaintly braided his hair.
Up then arose the crafty Loke,
Laufeyia’s son, and thus he spoke;
“A servant I thy steps will tend,
Together we must to Jotunheim wend.”
Now home the goats together hie;
Yoked to the axle they swiftly fly.
The mountains shook, the earth burn’d red,
As Odin’s sons to Jotunheim sped.
Then Thrym the king of the Thursi said;
“Giants, stand up; let the seats be spread:
Bring Freyia Niorder’s daughter down
To share my bed from Noatun.
With horns all gilt each coal-black beast
Is led to deck the giant’s feast;
Large wealth and jewels have I stored;
I lack but Freyia to grace my board.”
Betimes at evening they approach’d,
And the mantling ale the giants broach’d.
The spouse of Sifia ate alone
Eight salmons, and an ox full-grown.
And all the cates, on which women feed;
And drank three firkins of sparkling mead.
Then Thrym the king of the Thursi said;
“Where have ye beheld such a hungry maid?
Ne’er saw I a bride so keenly feed,
Nor drink so deep of the sparkling mead.”
Then forward leant the crafty Loke,
And thus the giant he bespoke;
“Nought has she eat for eight long nights,
So did she long for the nuptial rites.”
He stoop’d beneath her veil to kiss,
But he started the length of the hall, I wiss.
“Why are the looks of Freyia so dire?
It seems as her eyeballs glistened with fire.”
Then forward leant the crafty Loke,
And thus the giant he bespoke;
“Nought has she slept for eight long nights,
So did she long for the nuptial rites.”
Then in the giant’s sister came,
Who dared a bridal gift to claim;
“Those rings of gold from thee I crave,
If thou wilt all my fondness have,
All my love and fondness have.”
Then Thrym the king of the Thursi said;
“Bear in the hammer to plight the maid;
Upon her lap the bruizer lay,
And firmly plight our hands and fay.”<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c023'><sup>[91]</sup></a>
The Thunderer’s soul smiled in his breast,
When the hammer hard on his lap was placed;
Thrym first the king of the Thursi he slew,
And slaughter’d all the giant crew.
He slew that giant’s sister old,
Who pray’d for bridal gifts so bold.
Instead of money and rings, I wot,
The hammer’s bruises were her lot.
Thus Odin’s son his hammer got.</p>

<p class='c047'>“Skirnir, arise! and swiftly run,<br />

Bid him to parley, and enquire,<br />
’Gainst whom he teems with sullen ire.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Skirnir</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Ill words, I fear, my lot will prove,<br />
If I thy son attempt to move;<br />
If I bid parley, and enquire,<br />
Why teems his soul with savage ire.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Skirnir</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Prince of the gods, and first in fight,<br />
Speak, honoured Freyr, and tell me right!<br />
Why spends my lord the tedious day<br />
In his lone hall to grief a prey?”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Freyr</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“O how shall I, fond youth, disclose<br />
To thee my bosom’s heavy woes?<br />
The ruddy god shines every day,<br />
But dull to me his cheerful ray.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Skirnir</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Thy sorrows deem not I so great,<br />
That thou the tale shouldst not relate.<br />
Together sported we in youth,<br />
And well may trust each other’s truth.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Freyr</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“In Gymer’s court I saw her move,<br />
The maid, who fires my breast with love.<br />
Her snow-white arms and bosom fair<br />
Shone lovely, kindling sea and air.<br />
Dear is she to my wishes more,<br />
Than ere was maid to youth before:<br />
But gods and elfs<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c023'><sup>[102]</sup></a>, I wot it well,<br />
Forbid that we together dwell.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Skirnir</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Give me that horse of wonderous breed<br />
To cross the nightly flame<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c023'><sup>[103]</sup></a> with speed;<br />
And that self-brandish’d sword to smite<br />
The giant race with strange affright.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Freyr</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“To thee I give this wond’rous steed,<br />
To pass the watchful fire with speed;<br />
And this, which borne by valiant wight,<br />
Self-brandished will his foemen smite.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Skirnir</span> (<i>addressed to his horse</i>).—“Dark night is spread; ’tis time, I trow,<br />
To climb the mountains hoar with snow.<br />
Both shall return, or both remain<br />

<p class='c022'>Skirnir rode into Jotunheim to the court of Gymer; furious dogs were
tied there before the door of the wooden enclosure, which surrounded
Gerda’s bower. He rode towards a shepherd, who was sitting on a mound,
and addressed him:</p>
<p class='c047'>“Shepherd, who sittest on the mound,<br />
And turn’st thy watchful eyes around,<br />
How may I lull these bloodhounds, say!<br />
How speak unharm’d with Gymer’s may!”<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c023'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>The Shepherd</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Whence, and what art thou? doomed to die,<br />
Or dead revisitest the sky?<br />
For ride by night, or ride by day,<br />
Thou ne’er shalt come to Gymer’s may.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Skirnir</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“I grieve not, I; a better part<br />
Fits him, who boasts a ready heart.<br />
At hour of birth our lives were shaped;<br />
The doom of fate can ne’er be ’scaped.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Gerda</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“What sounds unknown mine ears invade,<br />
Frighting this mansion’s peaceful shade?<br />
The earth’s foundation rocks withal,<br />
And trembling shakes all Gymer’s hall.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>The Attendant</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Dismounted stands a warrior sheen;<br />
His courser crops the herbage green.”<br /></p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Gerda</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Haste, bid him to my bower with speed,<br />
To quaff unmix’d the pleasant mead:<br />
And good betide us!<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c023'><sup>[105]</sup></a> for I fear<br />

Or from the wiser Vanians sung?<br />
Alone to visit our abode<br />
O’er bickering flames why hast thou rode?”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Skirnir</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Nor Elf am I, nor Asian son;<br />

Yet o’er the bickering flames I rode<br />

Eleven apples here I hold,<br />
Gerda, for thee, of purest gold;<br />

<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Gerda</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Eleven apples take not I<br />
From man, as price of chastity!<br />
While life remains, no tongue shall tell,<br />

<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Skirnir</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Gerda, for thee this wonderous ring<br />

On each ninth night shall other eight<br />
Drop from it, all of equal weight.”<br /></p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Gerda</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“I take not, I, that wonderous ring,<br />

Gold lack not I in Gymer’s bower;<br />
Enough for me my father’s dower.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Skirnir</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Behold this bright and slender brand<br />

Deny not, maiden! lest thine head<br />
Be sever’d by the trenchant blade.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Gerda</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Gerda will ne’er by force be led<br />

<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Gerda</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“Now hail, now hail, thou warrior bold!<br />

To Vanian youth my hostile mind.”</p>
<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>Skirnir</span> (<i>sung</i>).—“I turn not home to bower or hall,<br />

poetry, which he had gained from the dwarfs. It is related in the Edda,
that the Asi and Vani, having been long at war, made peace, and spit
into a vase. From this the gods formed Kuaser, a person of exceeding
learning; and the dwarfs mixed his blood with honey, and so made the
liquor of poetry. The Vani were a Grecian colony, and this fable seems
to imply that both the learning and the poetry of the North was partly of
Greek origin. Odin, under the feigned name of Bolverk, entered into the
service of Bauge, brother of Suttungur, and drank up the liquor. A small
quantity of it, which he spilt, was scattered amongst men. It is observable,
that the name of <i>Suttungur</i>, from whom Odin gained this liquor, may denote
that he derived his poetry from the <i>Southern tongues</i>.</p>

who did not reign until two centuries afterwards—always supposing that
any dependence is to be placed on the chronology of the Scandinavians.
Yet an Olaf did reign at this period; and this only illustrates what we
observed in the first volume as to the confusion so evident in all the regal

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r135'>135</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Canute, king of all Denmark, England, and Norway, and of part of
Sweden, to Egelnoth the metropolitan, to archbishop Alfric, to all the
bishops and chiefs, and to all the nation of the English, both nobles and
commoners, greeting. I write to inform you that I have lately been at
Rome, <i>to pray for the remission of my sins</i>, and for the safety of my kingdoms,
and of the nations that are subject to my sceptre. It is long since I
bound myself by vow to make this pilgrimage; but I had been hitherto
prevented by affairs of state and other impediments. Now, however, I
return humble thanks to the Almighty God, that he has allowed me to
visit the tombs of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, and every holy place
within and without the city of Rome, and to honour and venerate them in
person. And this I have done, because I had learned from my teachers
that the apostle St. Peter received from the Lord the great power of binding
and loosing, with the keys of the kingdom of heaven. <i>On this account, I
thought it highly useful to solicit his patronage with God.</i> Be it moreover
known to you, that there was, at the festival of Easter, a great assemblage
of noble personages, with the lord the pope John, and the emperor Conrad,
namely, all the chiefs of the nations from Mount Gargano to the
nearest sea, who all received me honourably, and made me valuable presents;
but particularly the emperor, who gave me many gold and silver
vases, with rich mantles and garments. I therefore took the opportunity
to treat with the pope, the emperor, and the princes, on the grievances of
my people, both English and Danes; that they might enjoy more equal
law, and more secure safeguard in their way to Rome, nor be detained at
so many barriers, nor harassed by unjust exactions. My demands were
granted both by the emperor and by king Rodulf, who rules most of the
passages; and it was enacted by all the princes, that my <i>men</i>, whether pilgrims
or merchants, should, for the future, go to Rome and return in full
security, without detention at the barriers, or the payment of unlawful
tolls. I next complained to the pope, and expressed my displeasure, that
such immense sums should be extorted from my archbishops, when according
to custom they visited the apostolic see to obtain the pallium. A
decree was made that this grievance should cease. Whatever I demanded for
the benefit of my people, either of the pope, or the emperor, or the princes,
through whose dominions lies the road to Rome, was granted willingly, and
confirmed by their oaths, in the presence of four archbishops, twenty
bishops, and a multitude of dukes and nobles. Wherefore I return sincere
thanks to God that I have successfully performed whatever I had intended,
and have fully satisfied all my wishes. Now, therefore, be it known to you all,
that I have dedicated my life to the service of God, to govern my kingdoms
with equity, and to observe justice in all things. <i>If by the impetuosity or
negligence of youth, I have violated justice heretofore, it is my intention, by
the help of God, to make full compensation.</i> Therefore I beg and command
those to whom I have confided the rule, as they wish to preserve my friendship
or save their own souls, to do no injustice either to rich or poor.
Let all persons, whether noble or ignoble, obtain their rights according to
law, from which no deviation shall be allowed, either from fear of me, or
through favour to the powerful, or for the purpose of supplying my treasury.
I have no need of money raised by injustice. I am now on my road
to Denmark, for the purpose of concluding peace with those nations, who,
had it been in their power, would have deprived us both of our crown and
our life. But God has destroyed their means: and will, I trust, of his
goodness preserve us, and humble all our enemies. When I shall have
concluded peace with the neighbouring nations, and settled the concerns of
my eastern dominions, it is my intention to return to England as soon as
the fine weather will permit me to sail. But I have sent you this letter
beforehand, that all the people of my kingdom may rejoice at my prosperity.
For you all know that I never spared, nor will spare myself, or my
labour, when my object is the welfare of my subjects. Lastly, I entreat all
my bishops and all my sheriffs, by the fidelity which they owe to me and to
God, that the church-dues, according to the ancient laws, may be paid before
my return; namely, the plough alms, the tithes of cattle of the present
year, the Peter-pence, the tithes of fruit in the middle of August, and
the kirk-shot at the feast of St. Martin, to the parish church. Should this
be omitted, at my return I will punish the offender, by exacting the whole
fine imposed by law. Fare ye well.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<br />
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
